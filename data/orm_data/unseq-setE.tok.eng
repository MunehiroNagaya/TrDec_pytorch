The fraudulent and false election cannot benefit people except the authoritarians
The dictatorial regime of Tigrian colonialists that came to power by a military means cannot erase Ethiopia from the list of poor countries .
As the government failed to provide , it continues to receive foreign aid and the country still remains in the list of aid recipients .
The endless sabotage committed by those in power made the officials wealthy , while citizens could not provide for their survival and are losing hope . Many died at sea while traveling to seek for a living and many are living under harsh conditions in different countries .
The inhuman treatment of citizens like killing and imprisonment as well as banning free organizations and labeling freedom of expression as a criminal offense reveals the real situation in Ethiopia which is the worst not only in Africa but also in the World .
The sabotage , oppression , suppression , eviction and human rights violation of the last 24 years and its progress today casts darkness on the future of the country and makes its citizens hopeless . .
Weyane came by gun .
Also lived by gun .
Undoubtedly , it decided to bring future Ethiopia under one party dictatorship when it was in the jungle .
It has openelydeclared this .
The Woyane government , what the people need ?
What they are asking for ?
What they wished ?
As it is not willing to understand people's opinion and respond their question , the question of the people remains unanswered .
Weyane is only thinking about how to maintain the power it took by force .
Therefore , to legitmize its power , it uses different strategies .
One of the strategies it has been using to stay in power is holding false election every five years .
The election to be held on May 24 , 2015 will bring no change than legitimizing the power of Woyane .
That is not only because the electoral procedures cannot meet the requirements of a democratic electoral procedure , but also because the Woyane has not decided to hand over power to the people through a peaceful vote .
This 5th election is not different from the previous ones .
The electoral board conducting this election is established by and for the ruling party .
In addition , the threatening , imprisonment and intimidation of the people by Woyane puts the peace and freedom under question .
As OLF is familiar with the intention and conduct of Woyane and also as it do understand what the result of an election lacking transparency , fairness and democracy holds , it did not expect that the will and wish of the people will be fulfilled by the May 24 , 2015 election .
That is why it has been calling Ethiopians and especially Oromos to boycott the fake election of the Weyane .
Today people in Ethiopia are asking different questions and are struggling against the oppressive Woyane regime .
Out of those intensifying protest against the regime , the opposition from the Oromo people takes the leading position .
The Oromo people are sacrificing their life , losing their property and taking refuge in order not to participate on a false election that offers nominal seats .
They aspire to live freely by bringing an end to the political , social and economic oppression they shouldered for more than one century .
This wish and longing of the Oromo people cannot be realized by the election made under an authoritarian regime .
Therefore , OLF would like to repeatedly urge the Oromo people not to be fooled by this false election and to know that their problems cannot be resolved without struggle .
Taking part on this election is only legitimizing the government we are struggling against .
Taking part in an election that strengthens anti-Oromo people's government is only antagonizing those groups fighting against the regime .
Especially , the Oromo youth should understand the importance of continuing the antigovernment protest as a first choice in order to see the fruit of the sacrifices you have been making in moving the Oromo liberation struggle forward .
Refusing this election only for the hate of the Weyane or for the sake of competition is only pouring water over the sacrifices you paid so far .
Therefore , OLF strongly urges our people to boycott any action that legitimizes the power of Weyane regime and intensify their struggle for their right !
Victory to the Oromo People !
Oromo Liberation Front
Fake and false elections benefit only dictators , not the electorate .
The Tigrean ruling class which assumed power by the barrel of the gun has failed to take Ethiopia out of the ranks of the poor countries .
Unable to administer the people even with assistance obtained from foreign countries , the Empire finds itself among those countries that are reliant on foreign relief aid .
With corruption and robbery now reaching uncontrollable proportions , and as the general population has lost all hope of livelihood , the number of those who , out of desperation , are daily being drowned in the ocean and living a deplorable life in foreign countries is running high .
For the simple " offence " of freely expressing one's mind and desiring to live in freedom , citizens are subjected to killings , arrests , and torture . As a result , Ethiopia now finds itself among the first rank in Africa and indeed in the world of severity of political repression .
The exploitation , oppression , displacement of people from their homes and violations of human rights committed against citizens in the past 24 years have combined to darken the future of the country and its people .
The Woyanees came up by the gun .
And they have survived up until now by the gun .
Even in the future , their plan is to keep the country under a one-party rule of dictators , and , if not , undoubtedly to go back to the jungle again .
They have already proclaimed this openly .
The Woyane government has never asked , " What do the people want ?"
Or " What do they want ?"
Or " What do they desire ?"
Instead of finding out these answers and delivering solutions , the government chooses to keep silent and deny answers to the people's demands and questions .
The Woyane's only desire is to stick to the power that they got by force of arms in the first place .
Therefore , they are making use of various schemes to ensure their stay in power by whatever means .
Among the schemes they have used so far is the holding of fake elections every five years .
The May 24 , 2015 election brought no benefit except to consolidate the rule of the Wayanes .
In the first place , the election did not meet the established criteria of democratic elections . It also proved that the Wayane government had no desire whatsoever to relinquish power , whatever the election result was .
The 5[th ] round of elections was no different from the previous ones .
The so-called Electoral Board that oversees the elections is the handmaid of the present ruling party .
Meanwhile , the threats of intimidation , arrests , beatings and the harrasment inflicted on citizens have robbed the people of their peace and destabilized their lives .
ABO knows the Woyane mentality very well . It knows full well that the May 24 , 2015 election was not based on justice and democratic principles . It never expected the election to meet and fulfill the desires of the people .
That is why it issued a call to the Ethiopian peoples in general and the Oromo people in particular to boycott the past elections .
Today , the Ethiopian people are engaged in a bitter struggle and are voicing their demands to do away with the represssive regime of the Woyane government and to cripple its tentacles of oppression .
Among those fighting in the forefront in this struggle are the Oromo people .
Currently , the Oromo people are sacrificing their children and property not merely to gain two or twelve seats by participating in fake elections .
They struggle with the sole motive to overcome the political , economic and social problems to which they have been subjected for over a century now and to start living dignified and free lives .
But this desire cannot be achieved through the elections conducted under the auspices of the Woyane dictators .
Accordingly , ABO would like to issue a serious warning to the Oromo people to carefully consider this matter and to understand that they will never gain anything from this election .
Participating in the election would only mean facilitating conditions for the ruling clique which the people fight against .
Participating in the election is tantamount to consolidating the power of the anti-Oromo regime and putting one's neck in the yoke of slavery .
It is therefore imperative to further strengthen the anti-slavery resistance movement , thereby enabling the brave struggle of the Oromo youths to bear fruit .
Participating in the fake Woyane election would only mean undermining the heavy sacrifices already paid by our people at various levels .
Accordingly , ABO would like to call once again on the Oromo people to boycott the Woyane election , and to instead intensify its resistance struggle .
Victory to the Oromo people !
Oromo Liberation Front
The errand/message that ought to be dispatched !
Jiitu Lammii , March 24 , 2015 Neither criticism nor investigation will ever mend a scheme that went off its path .
Neither threat nor cajoling will straighten it either .
Do not boldly say " anyway we are done ..." , because the end result might not be so favorable .
Information leaked from sources close to the Oromiyaa government indicate that the EPRDF has been planning since the last two weeks an evil scheme of suppressing the uprising of the masses by indirectly using its surrogates and the OPDO .
According to the same source of information , high ranking OPDO officials and low-level cadres at the village level concocted a scheme by which they would be able to effectively suppress the mass uprising of the people through usage of force as well as peaceful negotiation to pacify the people .
Therefore , a campaign task force headed by Abbaa Duulaa and Muktaar Kadir ( it has been alleged that H/Marian joined the group ) has been formed and is already in action in towns such as Jimma , Amboo , Naqamtee , Fichee , Adaamaa , Shashamannee , Calanqoo and other places with the objective of seeking the support of the people .
They conceal the true nature of the plan and try to give it a good image so that they could get the support of the people .
For instance , the corner stone for the construction of a sports stadium in Fiichee was laid by an individual who calls himself President of the Oromiyaa region .
A similar gesture of being accepted by the people has been attempted during the official inauguration of the Calanqoo stadium .
Furthermore , same methods and attempts will be undertaken in other places as well . Thus , one way to weaken the mass movement is to attract the youth and win them over through the provision of funds and temporary employment opportunities .
By downplaying the insults of Abbay Tshayyee as a petty issue , and thus try to calm down the anger of the people .
To cover up the humiliation they suffered during their tours of foreign countries , pretend and flatter themselves as if they are in fact enjoying the support of the Diaspora .
Try to play down the Oromo struggle as baseless .
Try to threaten those who withstand their schemes and weaken their morale and spirit .
Though these might be their plans , yet it is clearly apparent that the people think in the opposite manner .
For example , as the information depicted above indicates , people who are in different administrative positions " should stop spilling the blood of their kin and kith and consuming the flesh of their own people !"
In other words , they should understand the reason for the mass uprising of the people and accept their demands .
This evidence shows clearly that the evil scheme does not resolve the demands of the people and subdue the rebellious mass movement .
Therefore , the agitation they are making will further enhance the awakening of the people and be a cause for more widespread disturbances , which of course is contrary to what they are hoping for , and thus will not resolve the demands of the people even slightly .
The mass uprising of people under a slavery system will never be suppressed or hindered .
A movement that is creates worry and fear , a movement built upon lies and cheating , such a movement cannot resolve the problems of the people and fulfill their hopes .
Even so , the enemy tries to stay in power by concocting such plans .
By deploying its collaborators , it attempts to listen to the heart beats of the people .
It utilizes the methods of cajoling and threats .
Uses sweet words .
Makes false promises .
Such phenomenon is not new for the Oromo people .
They have a fresh memory of events of the same kind which they experienced in the past .
When it is under pressure , " It establishes schools for children to learn Afaan Oromoo and builds a central Oromo cultural institute in Finfinnee !
" It also builds a sport stadium of international standard in Amboo and Naqamtee !
".. they said many things .
Even so , they ought to learn from history that the fundamental questions of the people cannot be considered as a petty matter and be bypassed through cover up and lies .
The question of the Oromo people is a question of self-rule and be a master of their own country .
This truism must be told to them without any hesitation or fear .
Whether it is Abbaaduulaa or Muktaar Kadir or H/Maaram Dassaleny , they are all messengers .
The message we have for these messengers is - " We are capable to take care of our own affairs . Therefore , leave us alone and go away !"
that is what we say .
If they assume that their evil deeds will frighten the people and discourage them from asking fundamental questions pertaining to their rights , then their attempts are tantamount to a mere futile exercise . The questions raised in Jimmaa , Amboo , Naqamtee , Mattuu or in Ciroo and Calanqoo , Roobee , Adaamaa and Yaa'abal'oo ... are fundamental questions of the Oromo people .
Though it is not necessary to call an eye witness to testify the sacrifices the Oromo people made for this truism , yet it is a matter of importance to consistently remind the other party who might have forgotten about it . The things you fear are on their way to uproot you .
Wishing you a successful year !
Message for a messenger !
Jiituu Lammii , March 24 , 2015 A misguided plan cannot be corrected by reviews and investigations .
Threats and flattery cannot correct it either .
Saying " how bad can it get..."and daring to go forward with it will also not make the end result any better .
Over the past couple of weeks , information leaked from the Oromia regional administration shows that the Woyanes have drafted a misguided plan in order to stifle popular protest and are using the OPDO to implement it .
According to this information , the new plan is to be implemented by everyone from senior OPDOs to those at the village level , using either incentives or threats .
This campaign , led by Abba Duula and Muktar Kadir ( lately Hailemariam was added ), has begun and is meant to win the hearts and minds of the people through misguided meetings to be held in cities like Jima , Ambo , Nekemte , Fiche , Adama , Shashamane , Calanqo and others .
They are trying to divert the emotions of the people emotions by making their visits appear worthwhile by decorating them with good names .
For example , the meeting in Fiche was led by the so-called President of Oromia .
In Calanqo the meeting was called as though it were meant to " celebrate the Calanqoo Statue ."
In other locations this is going to continue as usual , and they will try to convince the people with small amounts of money or by promising them temporary jobs .
They try to disclaim the insult by Abay Tsehaye some time ago .
They try to present their failure among the Diaspora , when they were conducting similar campaigns abroad , as a success and that they had good support .
They want to present the Oromo struggle as baseless .
They want to demoralize those who protest against them .
This is what they plan to do , but the sentiment on the part of the people is the opposite .
The people who are at different levels of the administrative structure need to "... stop letting the blood of their people and eating their flesh !"
It has been reported that they have taken action that reflects the peoples ' protests .
The misguided plan that off the line is not going to be a solution to the people's demands and protests .
Therefore , their provocation will make the people more aware of the facts in every corner of the country , but will not fulfill their goal of burying the people's questions and buying time for them .
In a country where there is oppression , it is not possible to stifle popular protests .
This kind of activity is a desperate action that emanates from the system's insecurity , and will not be an appropriate response to the people ' questions .
The enemy is trying to reorganize itself and buy some time by hiding behind these kinds of plans .
It is trying to use opportunist collaborators to listen to the heartbeat of the people .
It uses threats and rewards as a method .
Speaks smooth .
Makes false promises .
This kind of activity is not good for the Oromo .
Because they have seen this before , within recent memory .
When they are pressured , they say "... We will construct kindergartens and Oromo cultural centers for you in Finfinnee .
"... In Ambo and Nekemte , we will construct an international standard stadium .
"... they promise a lot .
The questions of the people are not something they can cover up with these simple impractical lies and they should have learned from history .
The Oromo question is a question of the ownership of their own land .
They do not hesitate to raise this question loud and clear wherever they go .
Be it Abba Dula , Muktar Kedir/Hailemariam Desalegn - all are messengers .
Our message to the messengers is that - " We are able to follow our own plan , and you go away !"
And this is it .
It is naive to believe that the Oromo people , who have raised a legitimate question , can be silenced simply by force or by providing petty benefits . Be it in Jima , Ambo , Nakemte , Mattu , Ciro , Adama or Yabelo ... the Oromo question is a question of rights .
It is obvious that the Oromo people have paid and are paying the ultimate sacrifice , including their priceless lives , to have their rights respected , and if anybody doubts this we will keep telling him louder so that he hears and understands well , while demonstrating by action...-What you are scared of is going to uproot you for sure !
Let this year be a year of success !
The plan the Wayyaanee regime has laid out for the lackey OPDO .
QEERROO
The Qeerroo of the Oromo Liberation 22-03-2015 FDR . The mass mobilization conducted by the Qeerroo Oromo students ' movement coupled with the broad based and much more strengthened Oromo liberation struggle has unnerved the Wayyaanee so much that it is compelled to devise a new plan and convey it to its servant , the OPDO . The rank and file of these lackeys encompasses district officials up to the Office of the President of the Oromiyaa region with the mandate to fully implement the program and see to it that its set objectives are realized .
According to leaked information we were able to receive , OPDO officials are planning to tour different towns in Oromiyaa and hold meetings to implement the plans given to them by Wayannee .
In this manner , the group which intends to sustain the minority led regime , whose leadership was formed in the arid region of Tigray and considers the Oromo people as its number one declared enemy , is in the process of holding continuous propaganda meetings starting March 6 , 2015 .
Reports reaching us indicate that Oromiyaa towns selected as target sites for the OPDO to convene the meeting for its propaganda are Adaamaa , Calanqoo , Amboo , Jimma , Shaashamannee , Naqamtee and Fiichee .
Accordingly , a panel discussion forum has been scheduled for March 13 and 14 , 2007 in Ambo in which trust worthy Wayannee messengers , namely Abbaaduulaa Gammadaa , Dhaabaa Dabalee , Salamoon Dasee and Isheetuu Dasee will be present with the objective to practically implement the planned peaceful protest and Panel forum .
A program devised by 7 people known as VVIP and VIP13 and in which 1143 individuals are expected to participate shows that people will be forced to take part in a demonstration to show their support for the regime and uphold its reputation while condemning the mass movement in which their own children are involved and are sacrificing their lives .
Even if a panel discussion is held , it would not be different from this .
According to a plan drafted for the construction of a sport's stadium in Fiichee town , an individual representing the President of the Oromiyaa region together with cabinet members and officials of the district and other low-ranking officers , is trying to convey the Wayannee plan to the community of the town .
Information leaked to us indicate that servants of the Wayannee called a general meeting of the people at the historical site of eastern Calanqoo to use the people as tools for their agenda and save Wayannee regime from its down fall .
The scheduled meeting in Calanqoo will be conducted on March 12 and will be attended not only by VVIP 62 and VIPn 82 and many other people , but also by such servants of the enemy as Muktar Kadir , Asteer Maammoo as well as member of the KHR OPDO . These stogies of the Wayannee , who do their very best to sustain the dominance of the Habeshaa over the Oromo people , are planning a meeting to be convened on March 20 , 2015 in Calanqoo , a historic place where the Habeshaa rulers cut off hands of men and breasts of women .
With the pretext of convening a meeting to conduct a panel discussion about the so-called election , but in reality , to garner support for Wayannee and condemn the FDR , OPDO officials who could track back their founding to the cave of Adeet , are running around in Adaamaa town like mad dogs .
Hence , about 62 individuals known as VVIP , 245 and VIP as well as 18994 are planning a panel discussion meeting on 6-8 at the office of Abbaa Gadaa with the intention of waging propaganda .
It has been revealed that strict orders have been given by Wayannee that the meetings be conducted on March 13-14 , 2007 according to Ethiopian calendar . The conference at Adaamaa will be led by OPDO officials such as Umar Hasan , Adul'aziz Muhammad , Sufiyaan Ahmad and Alamaayyo Taganuu while the Shaashamannee event will be conducted by the surrogates Warqinaa Gabayyo , Nuuree Qamar and Birhaan Tsgsggaayee and be held in the presence of VIPn 6 and VVIPn 10 in which a total of 140 people will take part .
From amongst the jobs created by Wayanne , the one that must have priority and needs immediate attention iregards the statement made by Abbaay Tsehaayye pertaining to the Finfinnee master plan . This needs to be raised in a meeting forum whereby the cadres must pass resolution and show case it as if it enjoys the full support of the people and announce this issue publicly .
Furthermore , information obtained indicate that an idea is being entertained to mobilize the residents of Amboo town for a peaceful demonstration and show case this as if peace and stability is prevailing allover Oromiyaa , entice the youth through provision of temporary employment opportunities and making funds available to them so as to draw them away from trouble , if possible recruit the youth to be involved in the election process , deploy trust worthy individuals both old and young to function as agents , make believe that the OLF does not exist anymore and recruit individuals coming from somewhere else by offering them petty rewards and encourage them make false statements about the non-existence of the OLF , dismiss cadres who tend to sympathy with or support the mass movement and replace them with absolutely trustworthy individuals who can easily be subordinates of the enemy .
Well informed sources show that those orders have been specifically issued by Abbaaduula Gammadaa and Muktaa Kadir and at this moment numerous meetings are being conducted in Oromiyaa while there exists an atmosphere of uneasiness , fear , threat and the OPDO is very much engaged to cover up existing realities in various forms and fulfill the wishes of Wayannee .
The method devised by the Wayannee regime to fight the movement of the Oromo people in general , and specifically the impact the movement of the Oromo students exerts upon Wayanne can be categorized into three groups .
First , the regime being shaken up to its core by the Oromo struggle , that is being conducted internally by the unarmed gallant and resolute Oromo youth who also dared to face the armors and military might of the regime and which has drawn the attentions of the Oromo people and that of the international communities , is in the process to suppress and cover up the struggle through propaganda and cajoling .
The other point is that after failing to suppress the movement of the people in general and specially its inability to win the enlightened youth to its side , it has now resorted to silencing the voice of the youth .
Therefore , Wayannee has commanded the OPDO to follow up and adhere to meeting procedure , which is presumed to have its own covert agenda .
The plan of the enemy entails verbal persuasion of the students wherever their struggle has gained momentum , and militarily control the daily lives of people in areas such as Jimmaa , Naqamte and Bale .
The third point envisaged specially to entice the Diaspora is to exert pressure on opposition groups and put them out of political game while at the same claiming that their party is democratic .
Leaked information that fell into our hands exposes the activities of individuals who retuned back to this country after their abode in many different countries and who are now working for the enemy against the OLF .
Apparently , there are signs whereby certain individuals are very much active to implement the missions of the enemy at various locations .
The apparent uneasiness of Wayannee indicates its inevitable downfall while the inner circle of the OPDO is in disarray and rotten to its core .
OPDO representatives of Oromo ethnic origin serving in different capacities have resolved and vowed to do their utmost best to enable the Oromo liberation movement to attain its envisaged goals and have already started to demonstrate this in action .
The Liberation Qeerro of OLF...............Victory of the Oromo people will flourish .
The Woyane government formulates plans for its messenger , OPDO .
QEEROO
Qeerroo Oromo Liberation ( 22-03-2015 ) FDG . The Woyane government , which has been greatly worried by the intensified Oromo liberation resistance movement , issued a new plan this week for its messengers in OPDO . The Oromo youth struggle , started by Oromo students , is expanding and consolidating the Oromo liberation struggle everywhere . Meanwhile , Woyane messengers from the kebele to the cabinet level of the Oromia President's office received the new Woyane-devised plan for implementation under compulsion .
According to news leaking from insiders and reaching us , OPDO officials have been holding meetings to devise ways and means for implementing the new Woyane plan .
Beginning March 6 , 2015 , OPDO officials have been holding uninterrupted meetings to implement Wayane policies drawn up by the TPLF in the Tigrean lowlands in a bid to suppress their enemies the Oromos .
The same news sources confirmed that the Oromia towns especially targeted to be covered by OPDO's deafening propaganda are Adama , Calanqo , Ambo , Jimma , Shashemane and Naqamte , as well as Fiche .
The plan was initially designed to be implemented in Ambo town on March 13 and 14 , 2017 , at a ceremony to be marked by a public demonstration and a panel discussion in the presence of Wayane messengers , including Aba Dula Gammada , Dhaba Dabale , Solomon Dessie and Eshetu Dessie .
This program was planned to be attended by an estimated 1143 people , 7 of whom were to be VVIPs , and 13 VIPs . It was thought that the plan would bring together Oromo nationals by force to hold a demonstration at which to condemn the ongoing resistance movement , thereby nullifying the heavy sacrifices paid by our nationalists .
The aim of the panel discussion was no different .
And according to the program prepared to be held in Fiche town , the President of Oromia , along with his cabinet members and zonal administration members , was supposed to be present in the town in the name of establishing a cornerstone for the construction of a stadium . The Wayanes planned to put across their message to the people at such an event .
The same inside news sources also disclosed that Wayane forces have been running up and down in efforts to save their masters from imminent catastrophe . Accordingly , they prepared a special program in the historic town of Calanqo in East Oromia by assembling the people there .
The Calanqo program was intended to be held in the presence of 62 VVIPs and 82 VIPs , including enemy messengers like Muktar Kedir , Aster Mammo and other OPDO members , on March 12 , 2017 . It will be recalled that these messengers of the Woyanes and agents of the Habesha rule held a meeting in Calanqo on March 20 , 2015 as a gesture of mockery at the same place where past rulers cut off the hands and breasts of Oromos .
In Adama town , the same messengers were seen running up and down to protect their masters in Adet cave , and planned to hold a panel discussion to consolidate the power of their masters and also to solicit support for the fake elections .
Accordingly , they finalized a plan to hold a panel discussion in the Abba Gada conference hall in the presence of 245 VVIPs and 62 VIPs for an estimated 18,994 people .
In Shashemane town , the panel was intended to be held on March 13-14 , 2017 , while the panel in Adama town was planned to be held in the presence of Umer Hassan , Abdul Aziz Mohamed , Sufian Ahmed and Alemayehu Tegenu , who would chair the panel . The Shashemanne panel was supposed to be moderated by Woyane agents like Workineh Gebeyehu , Nuuree Qamari and Birhan Tsegaye in the presence of 140 people , including 10 VVIPs and 6 VIPs .
One of the tasks in implementing the Wayane policy is to carefully heed the speech made by Abbay Tsehaye concerning the Finfinnee Master Plan . The speech requires that Wayane cadres pass a resolution giving the impression that the people have fully supported the so-called master plan .
Another one of their plans is to call popular demonstrations to give the impression that peace is a reality in Oromia . It is also planned to prevent youths from holding protests by giving them money , to persuade youths to support them in the elections , to deploy their agents among the people and overhear their secrets , to spread adverse propaganda about the OLF and its policies , to invite self-seeking Oromos from abroad to make speeches in support of Wayane policies , and to expel OPDO members who sympathize with the Oromo cause and replace them with Wayane-trained agents .
The same news sources disclosed that an order was personally delivered to the cadres by Abba Dula Gamada and Muktar Kedir . It has been revealed that right now Oromia is overworked by meetings in the different meeting halls , at which the Woyanes are engaged in hurling insults and threats of intimidation at OPDO members and requiring them to implement their plans .
Generally , the Wayanes have taken pains to draw up a plan by which to suppress the Oromia popular struggle and the Oromo youth resistance movement . The Wayanes have handed over this elaborate plan to their OPDO cadres for implementation . Let us consider a few points of this plan .
Realizing that the level of the Oromo people's struggle has given them a serious headache , and that the Oromos have managed to confront the fully armed enemy with their bare hands , and that this struggle is gaining increased support at the local and international levels , the Wayanes are doing their best to stop this development at any cost , especially through intensified propaganda .
Secondly , the Wayanes are striving to weaken Oromo youths , who represent the major development force of Oromia . Having failed to control them physically , the Wayanes are now declaring propaganda warfare to thereby silence Oromo voices .
This is evidenced by the places chosen by the Wayanes to conduct the OPDO meetings .
While some of the meetings are held at places where the student resistance movement has grown strong , others are held where the people are already surrounded by a strong military presence in their own towns .
The third point is that the Wayanes are spreading deafening propaganda about their fake elections and democratic processes in order to cleverly win the favor of Oromos in the Diaspora . The Wayanes have continued to put pressure on public bodies , forcing them to accept actions that are beyond normal political procedures .
According to secrets leaked to us , the Wayanes have a plan to use Diaspora Oromos to come home and support them in foiling the Oromo liberation struggle .
This is not merely a plan . It is also being widely implemented at several places , with the enemy running up and down everywhere .
The mounting tension being witnessed among the Wayanes is one more bit of evidence that the downfall of the enemy is fast approaching . It seems that the Wayanes and the OPDO are rotting inside and falling apart .
The Wayanes are particularly shocked by the discovery that OPDO representatives who are full-blooded Oromos , and genuine ones at that , are doing their best in support of Oromo freedom . This development has distressed them considerably .
ABO Qeerroo Liberation shall flourish ! Victory for the Oromo people !

They oppose but also support nationalism !
The Ethiopian government was overthrown 24 years due to its failure to respect the fundamental human rights .
The regime that was built through the military power could as well have been saved by the military .
They attempt to cover up the true nature of imperialism and show case it as if it were a democratic system .
Through this declaration , it tried to keep the promise it made for the protection of the unity of Ethiopia by military campaign but met the fate of its own dismissal through war .
The design to hand over Ethiopia to its descendants failed and instead it experienced its own collapse through military action , bringing in the peaceful closure of that chapter .
If we go back and have a look at what has taken place during the past 24 years , we observe that in the pretext of unity , equality and democracy their military was in fact trying to sustain the superiority of the colonialists .
The sole intention of the daily lectures on so called equality was merely to mislead and try to fool the people and is thus far removed and different from the practical reality .
The system that was established without political activities enabled dictatorship to flourish .
It suppressed the people who raised the right to freedom .
It erased totally the Indi dual and group rights .
Though the military regime tried to suppress the rights of the people through its military might and the barrel of the gun , yet the people resolved not to support it but instead aided the democratic and revolutionary movement thus contributing to the over throw of the regime .
The group that assumed power after the war , declared that it will usher in changes sought by the people .
Even so , what the people observed within a brief period was that its plan and end goals were not far removed from those of the previous regime .
The only difference between the two regimes is in their respective plans and tactics of governing the Ethiopian empire .
On one hand the Derge led Ethiopian empire had the scheme to maintain the regime under the cover of socialism , while the Wayannee is trying to do the same as a revolutionary , democratic and development oriented regime .
It is only those who benefit from the existence of the current regime who claim or assume that the regime is not being opposed by the people in every part of the country .
Everyone else demands the respect of their rights without any curtailment .
That is why they are struggling .
Clear evidences are the resistances and steps taken by the people in different administrative regions .
Tangible evidences show the demands of the people will continue without any let up and in a more forceful way if these demands do not receive satisfactory and unambiguous responses .
Nowadays , all people have reached a stage where they cannot be fooled any more by false and untrue unity .
People do not have any problem of identifying the so-called unity and democracy but which is in fact enshrined in machinations and injustice .
Who did stand for the truth ?
Who is openly/publicly supporting the continuation of enslavement and oppression ?
Who wishes to spread the greed for power and the system of oppression in a new fashion ?
if there is anyone who claims or believe that the people are not able to differentiate or understand these questions , then such a person is either not with the people or he/she does not want to do with their ideas and wishes .
That is why it is claimed that unless otherwise a fundamental change for the respect for human and people's rights are exercised , Ethiopia would not be free from troubles , oppression and exploitation
There are many political organizations in the Ethiopian empire which are engaged to realize " unity " in a peaceful manner or through other means .
Even though they pretend to showcase such missions and stated goals , yet it is possible to present points in which they resemble .
they consider nation based organizations as sin and evil , and vehemently condemn federalism as a false institution brought forth by Wayannee .
These tangible steps by which people raise questions pertaining to the respect of their respective nationality and nations as well as cultures and native languages are considered as anti-unity and enemy .
Is became apparent that the few individuals who oppose federalism based on ethnicity are in fact fighting more for their own group .
Though they condemn ethnic based organizations , yet it is apparent that they themselves are organized in the same fashion as evidenced by the composition of their supporters and members .
Though they openly lament on daily basis that unity based on political organizations serving their own people are being dismantled and weakened and come to their rescue through campaign and assistance , yet they never try to speak on behalf of , or campaign for or rescue of other people when these are exposed to problems of similar nature .
These types of action reveal themselves not only in political organizations but also are existing phenomenon including human rights organizations working locally on national basis .
Education should be the most determining factor for the development of a country .
The only way to produce educated people who will assume leadership of a country in the future is when democratic rights are respected and peace prevails .
The recurrent movements of the Oromo students can function as a glaring evidence for the absence of these rights .
Who are those who claim to fight for democracy and equally but silently stand by the way side and act as spectators when due to the demand for the respect of human rights in Oromiyaa , Oromo university students were themselves exposed to the hitherto unapparelled punishment and acts and hundreds of university students were dismissed .
When Oromo youth and their friends were mercilessly gunned down in Amboo , the failure of those who claim to be struggling for one Ethiopian nationality to utter a word has made their view of democracy and equality questionable .
Even though it is claimed that all prisons in the Ethiopian empire have been constructed for the incarceration of Oromo prisoners , it is incomprehensible as to why Oromo intellectuals , the educated , youth and elderly do not expose these facts by saying that these prisons are places where the Oromo people are being imprisoned en mass , tortured , humiliated and suffer .
which says should have a response .
What will happen in the future to known individuals who , instead of opposing the ongoing plan to expand Finfinnee and thereby displace the Oromo people from their lands , are queuing up with land grabbers simply to enrich themselves ?
is the question .
Which one that claims the respect for human rights and humanity ?
asks oneself .
Those who forget what happened in the past and are unable to perceive today's events , despise the people , deny and violate the inalienable rights of individuals or consider and condemn people as if they were livestock or wild beasts , and when they standing for the rights of just one ethnic group , would these people be able to comprehend what they are doing ?
Why are they keeping silent and consider it differently when other people are being ridiculed and beaten up in their own administrative regions ? On the other hand , they loudly lament and hold demonstrations when ay one from their side is insulted or mistreated .
Though it is possible to present other evidences in addition to what has been presented above , yet they are sufficient to show case the intentions and plans of political organizations as well as the reasons as to why they are standing for the protection of human rights .
The desire for democracy , equality and unity shows what it is .
Attempts to Ehiopianize all under the umbrella of merely one ethnic group is not only a futile and archaic attempt but is tantamount to try save spilt water .
Objecting to nationalism , supporting nationalism !
SBO ( March 12 , 2015 ) The Ethiopian government which was in place 24 years ago came to power in the midst of rampant violation of peoples ' rights .
The aim of that military government was to keep the country under subjugation , just like the previous government did , which was also founded on force .
It came to power wearing the mask of socialism by listing the faults of its predecessor and by making a show of democracy .
Based on its deceptive ideology , it declared war and swore to itself to keep Ethiopia's national unity by military force , but was later destroyed by military force itself .
But its desire to rule the country in that way went unrealized , and the military government's chapter of rule was closed in that way .
Looking back at the history of the past 24 years and beyond , we realize that the purpose of the military junta was merely to consolidate the power of the Neftegna in the name of unity , equality and democracy .
It used to preach the principle of equality for deceptive purposes , while its real purpose was totally different .
The political system proclaimed at the time only strengthened the arm of the dictators .
It suppressed the right of the people to raise any demands for their rights .
At the same time , it suppressed the voices of people that demanded respect of their rights .
Although the military government made every effort to suppress the rights of the people by military force and by the gun , the people kept on aspiring for their rights by means of the struggle for freedom and democracy , and thus managed to unseat the dictatorship at last .
The clique that came to power after the military government promised to bring about the changes desired by the people .
However , by gradual degrees , its policies and purposes proved to be no different from those of its predecessors .
The only difference between the two governments , both of which came to power by force , was in the language that they used in stating their respective policies .
While the Derg regime had a policy of ruling the country under the guise of socialism , the Wayane government laid down a policy sweetened with revolutionary democracy and development-oriented principles .
Today , if there are any people who are not opposed to the Wayane system , it is only those that derive some benefit from the system .
All other people are seriously demanding the full respect of their rights .
And that is why they are engaged in struggle .
The resistance movement and the anti-government demonstrations taking place in the various regions are adequate proof of this .
These anti-government demonstrations also come as additional proof that the people won't slacken their resistance until their demands receive genuinely satisfactory solutions .
Today , all of the people have reached a stage whereby they cannot be deceived by a false sense of unity .
The people have no problem identifying injustices committed in the name of unity and democracy .
Who is standing up for the truth ?
Who is preaching falsehood with the aim of prolonging the system of oppression ?
Who is striving to construct a new system of oppression ?
If there are those who think that the people do not even understand the nature of the demands that they have raised , these are not of the people , or they are those that refuse to listen to the demands of the people .
That is why it is widely said that , so long as the rights of peoples and nationality rights are not respected , Ethiopia cannot be liberated from the system of exploitation , oppression and slavery .
The number of political parties striving to bring about change , peacefully or otherwise , in the name of `unity' is high .
Although they appear to have different plans and purposes , they have very much in common .
Organizations that regard the purpose of nationality-based organizations as fake , a sin and a crime are at the same time observed to condemn the false federal system of the Wayanes .
With such a double standard , they consider all those who raise the questions of nationality , culture or language as anti-unity groups or enemies .
While hating those that are organized on a basis of nationality or federalism , they are also observed struggling for their own nationalities themselves .
While condemning nationality-based organizations , they are also organized in a similar manner . This is evidenced by the background and nature of their members or supporters .
Political organizations that operate in the name of national unity seem to stand for the causes of displaced or wronged groups but , when assistance comes from other countries in the form of food or otherwise , the assistance is not seen to reach the people .
Such actions are not only seen among political organizations , but are also observed among human rights organizations structured at the national level .
Education is vital and decisive for the development of any country .
But education means nothing when the student does not engage with or work for the good of the country by upholding democratic rights and peace .
This is best illustrated by the resistance movement seen from time to time among Oromo students .
Oromo students , whether yesterday or today , have been paying bitter sacrifices in the process of demanding protection for the rights of the people . They have taken actions that are considered unique in the history of the country and in Oromia , even at the cost of being expelled from their schools in their hundreds . But the above-mentioned political organizations have chosen to stand passively by in the face of such gross injustices all along . And these are the organizations that claim to stand for democracy and equality .
The fact that these organizations have remained totally silent in the face of the cold-blooded killing of Oromo youths and children in Ambo town has left doubt as to their worth in the struggle for equality and democracy .
Why have such organizations , that speak for the cause of democracy and human rights , refrained from making any comment , even while Oromo elders , sages , youths and others were sent to jail in great numbers , as if the country's prisons were built only for the Oromos ?
This should have been a question that deserved an answer .
At this point in time , when every effort is made to subject Oromos to displacement and impoverishment under the pretext of expanding Finfinnee , the above political organizations are seen aligning themselves with the enemy in grabbing Oromo lands in a bid to enrich themselves through so-called investment schemes . And what will be the next stage ?
This also needs to be answered .
What then is the meaning of their stated principle that human and democratic rights be respected ?
People also ask this question .
These people are seen staging demonstrations each time their own peoples are insulted or wronged , but they keep quiet any time other peoples are insulted or wronged , or even beaten in their administrative regions . How can this happen ?
Such organizations only look at yesterday and not today . On the one hand , these look down on the rights of others , especially on those that raise questions of nationality and insult them by reducing them to subhuman standards , or to the standard of animals or people that cannot think . On the other hand , they are observed fighting for the cause of the peoples they sprang from . How can one reconcile these two viewpoints ?
It is possible to show even more evidence . But the above facts are sufficient proof to show the nature of the policies advanced by such political organizations .
It is possible to understand from these facts the kind of democracy , equality and unity principles that they aspire to uphold .
Trying to protect the rights of only one nationality group under the cover of Ethiopianism is outdated , and is tantamount to drawing water from a river that has already flowed away .

QEERROO : Oromo students attending secondary and preparatory schools in Midaa Qany and Calliya districts of the East Shewa Zone are continuing with their revolutionary struggle in Eastern Shewa Zone .

Hence , it has been reported that the ordinary people and the youth formed a united front in all corners of Oromiyaa and have started waging a revolutionary struggle . Especially the closure of the secondary and preparatory schools in Midaa Qanyii and Ballammii highlights the fact that a revolutionary movement has been started .

QEERROO : Oromo Student Protest Continues In a More Organized Way ; In Secondary Schools in Midaa Qeny and Calliyaa Districts , West Shagar , an FDG Protest Has Begun .
March 4 , 2015 Qeeroo report for March 3 and 4 , 2015 In the secondary schools of Midaa Qeny and Calliyaa Districts , West Shagar , an FDG protest has begun in an organized way , and Ballamii Secondary School and Preparatory School and Gedoo Secondary School and Preparatory School have all been closed down .

The true machnination of stogies and their masters
Wayanne has revealed its total arrogance and how much it despises the Oromo people through its current deployment of stooges in the Diaspora .
As the plans devised by Wayanne coupled with its arrogance cannot be fully accounted for at this moment , we will try to touch base on it extensively in our next written presentation .
For the moment we will focus on the deployment of the messengers .
During the time when Oromo patriots were following up the messengers in different towns and trying to undermine and disable their mission , I heard a broadcasting on the Ethiopian TV that exposed this mission and which made me to raise my pen - excuse me .
It is obvious that Wayanne messengers were deployed to Australia , North America , Saudi Arabia , and Scandinavia .
Right now , they are planning to be deployed in some African countries .
We all have heard that of the plans they have devised for Africa , the Kenyan one has completely failed .
This could be considered as a victory of the patriots who saw to it failure .
The fundamental reason for the deployment of agents is due to the hatred people have for them does not want to approach them coupled with the fat that Oromo nationals all over the world had staged demonstration during the year 2014 has shaken them up . That is , it became necessary to deploy these messengers to lull people for their good .
The FDG revolutionary struggles conducted by Qeero locally coupled with the world-wide movements have not only caused a serious headache to the Wayanne but also incapacitated it not to govern peacefully and therefore the regime is trying to buy time and disband these forces opposing it from outside as well as outside .
Some of the archaic plans they use consist of arranging Diaspora marriage ceremonies in the country itself and show case as if the Oromo people living in foreign countries are supporting them though the report of the Ethiopian TV clearly evidence for how futile and false this assumption is .
According to reports by patriots who had knowledge of and were present at the meeting , questions were raised regarding killing of students , their hauling into prions , their dismissal from school as well as issues concerning the grabbing of land as well as the Master Plan , none of which received satisfactory response .
Everywhere they secretly went , people who were allowed in were merely opportunists like themselves and those who have been invited .
What would you say about these opportunists , who are despised by the Oromo whenever they meet them at a coffee shop and even a non-Oromo considers them as a trash ?
In the video presentation they conducted to a very small audience , the main issue reiterated much was about Development and again Development .
This is equivalent to and not different from Minilik's version of Development ( Maqnat ) with which he displaced the Oromo people from their lands , but as the same time it shows the reality that the people are more conscious and alert than the other party assumes .
The other methods through which they try to fool people are by saying they would make land available for construction of houses , create business opportunities and numerous services or the people will be able to purchase condominium and similar other things .
What most amazing is the fact while Wayannee's cabinet is overflowing with cash , the fate of the Oromo people became ejection from their lands and that the so-called development has no meaning for them .
Even though some individuals who were misled by opportunists but also sold their conscience and returned home to do business or build houses experienced significant losses and failure , yet they are bold enough to disperse false information they have been fed which in fact is far removed from the truth .
Everywhere they go , they are trying to establish committees consisting of opportunist .
Amongst this is the one established in the city of Stockholm by individuals from whom the people expects nothing .
If we could just mention just for historical purpose , these are the individuals - 1 . Dirree Misheele Rufael ( or darajje mishel ) in the status of chairman of the committee 2 . Xaafa GHonfa 3 . Saiid Jibril , 4 . Shaame Yusuf , 5 . Abdul Waasi .
All these individuals are opportunist and derelicts who were granted asylum as Oromos .
Therefore , the surrounding community should be alert and protect itself against these individuals as well as exposed them in all means possible .
A lot has been learned from the deployment of these Wayanee messengers .
First , it is very important for the surrounding communities to know who is who , because the information will contribute to and is product of the struggle .
The other thing is that the community would be able to gain knowledge from the way they convene secret meetings and utilize the experience gained for future emergency actions and be ready to utilize it .
We have gained vital knowledge from the exposure of those who superficially appear to be our supports , but are in fact working underground for the enemy .
The presence of these Wayannee messengers helped us to identify such individuals as Dr . Galaanaa Gobanaa , who lives in the city of Stockholm and whom we never thought would entertain such an idea .
As we tried to mention it previously , it should be noted that the motive of this deployment is to weaken the Qeerroo revolutionary movement inside the country .
The point they forget to understand though is that the movement being carried out outside of the country is not a foundation for the one ongoing inside the country .
The other method is to disrupt the unity of refugees in the neighboring countries , transplant agents in their midest , cause confusion and false rumors , carry out businesses in the name of refugee , endanger the right to live in a country where they were granted refugee status .
On the other side , they consider it as a success in weakling of OLF if they would be able to defame and spread false rumors about the patriotic Oromo individuals who live both inside and outside of the country .
Therefore , we advise strongly those individuals who live in the Diaspora , those who had to flee the brutality of the enemy and ended up in a foreign country to strictly protect yourselves from opportunists who are registered with the UNHCR as well as with other governments in the name of a refugee , but are in fact agents of the Wayanee regime .
It is very important to known exactly and expose this type of individuals who give themselves original Oromo names and register themselves with the UNHCR to be recognized as refuges or are registered with different governments to get the status of refugees .
It is a very important thing to realize that the reason as to why the blood of Oromo has been spilt , third bones smashed into pieces , the Oromo people are being hauled en mass into prisons and why Oromo people must flee the country , is not to sustain the current Wayanee regime but to completely uproot the systems Wayanne and successive regimes .
Oromo Patriotism will prevail and the Oromo people wil defeat the machination of Wayannee and its surrogates .
Messengers on an errand for their masters .
Currently , the Wayanes are openly showing their contempt for the Oromo people by sending their agents abroad for subversive purposes .
With such a contemptuous attitude and such genocidal actions that the Wayanes are taking against the Oromo people now going out of bounds , we would like to say a few words regarding this .
Let us first focus on the dispatch abroad of Wayane messengers .
It was as I was following news events about the successes of Oromo nationalists who have broken the backbone of Wayane envoys in different Oromo towns that I happened to come across a TV program in which I heard what the Wayanes are scheming and saying . I then decided to raise my pen to put things correctly .
As is known , Wayane messengers have been dispatched to Australia , Latin America , Saudi Arabia and Scandinavia recently .
And right now , they are preparing other envoys to be dispatched to some African countries .
All of us have heard how their plan to send their messengers to Kenya and its neighbors had miserably failed .
This represented only one part of the efforts of our nationalists to foil the enemy's dispatch of its agents abroad .
Generally , the international dispatch of Wayane messengers was motivated by the need to soothe Oromo nationalists abroad , having been utterly hated by Oromos at home . It is known that Diaspora Oromos have been shocked by the brutal actions taken by the Wayanes against Oromos at home .
The resistance movement begun by Oromo FDG Qeerroo youths and which now covers the whole country has become a headache for the Wayane government . The aim of dispatching Wayane messengers abroad is therefore born of the fear that they can no longer rule the country as they please . The flurry of activity these days is therefore only a time-buying endeavor on the part of the enemy .
This outmoded policy of organizing a Diaspora Festival was devised by their agents , who live only for their stomachs , with the aim being to give the impression to others that Diaspora Oromos are on the Wayane side .
Those Oromos who participated in such meetings with the Wayanes previously have disclosed at the time that they did not get any answers to all the questions they had raised in connection with the killing of the Oromo students , their arrests and expulsion from school , as well as the seizure of Oromo lands .
The messengers moved here and there , hiding away from the eyes of the people , and only held talks with a handful of hand-picked Oromos who were privately or secretly invited .
The messengers had been wondering among themselves what to say to even those few they had invited , who seemed to say that they represented the Oromo people .
At the meetings that they held with these ones , the record of which was shown on video , they only talked about development and again development .
Just like Minilik also talked about development in the name of `Maqnat' in those days , and reduced Oromos in their own homeland to nothingness , these ones are also repeating history , totally oblivious that the level of consciousness of the Oromos has redoubled , and even surpassed their own .
At the meetings , they tried hard to deceive their audience with allurements , promising to give them lands on which to build houses , providing incentives for new business opportunities and for buying condominiums .
What is especially amazing is that the Wayanes don't seem to understand the extent of the Oromo people's problem of displacement from their lands . The enemy only focuses on the wealth it is accumulating in the name of development .
On the other hand , it is also amazing that these Wayanes , while fully realizing their past bankruptcy , are still unashamed to stand in front of the people and talk . This shows that the sole aim of these people is only to fill their stomachs , and nothing else .
The other thing that they do during their visits is to set up petty committees as overseers .
In Stockholm , they set up a Scandinavian committee which had nothing to do with the promotion of the people's interests .
Just to mention a few of these appointees on the various committees , they are : 1 . Dirree Misheele Ruphael , or Dereje Mishel , 2 . Xafa Gonfa Warra , 3 . Sayed Jibril , 4 . Saame Yusuf , and 5 . Abdul Wassi .
These are useless elements that got refugee status by being Oromo .
That being the case , the people living in those places are expected to stand alert always and expose such elements in their midst .
A lot of lessons have been learnt from the dispatch abroad of these Wayane messengers .
The first lesson learnt is that the communities in those countries have managed to find out who is who in their ranks .
The second is that community members have attained a higher level of consciousness about the Wayane mentality , and are therefore able to call their own emergency meetings to discuss how to go about frustrating enemy schemes when the messengers come to them again .
The third lesson is that the people are no longer in the dark about the nature of those that move about as nationalists while being in the pay of the enemy .
For instance , the coming of the Wayane messengers to Stockholm has unveiled the true nature of people like Dr . Galana Gobana , whom nobody previously suspected would be seen at such places .
As we tried to mention earlier , the whole idea of sending such messengers is to weaken the Oromo Qeerroo resistance movement back home .
One thing they failed to understand is that the local Qeerroo resistance movement is the foundation for other similar struggles abroad .
The aim of these messengers is also to shatter the hopes of refugees , both at home and in neighboring countries , and to lead them to the point of losing their refugee status .
It seems that these messengers are also trying to weaken the ABO liberation struggle by deceiving Oromo nationals at home and abroad .
That being the case , all those refugees who are denied their rights at home and forced to choose a life of exile need to guard against those elements who go by the name of refugees and seek UNHCR support . It has to be known that those elements who look the most like refugees are agents in the payroll of the Wayanes .
These elements are out to discredit real Oromo refugees who get UNHCR support , and therefore we have to examine the situation carefully and expose such elements .
It needs to be borne in mind that the motive of such elements is to make it impossible for genuine Oromo refugees to find a place of refuge abroad , even after shedding their blood and paying heavy sacrifices to escape from local torture .
Nationalism shall flourish ! Oromos shall gain victory over the Wayanes and their agents .

The mission of the Wayanne stogies to Melbourne , Australia failed completely .
February 1 , 2025 : Oromo nationals living in the city of Melbourne , Australia scored a victory in blocking and hindering a meeting planned to be held by messenger OPDO members led by an individual called Abdulhaaziiz , who claims to be the deputy administrator of the Oromia regional state .
A few Amara and Ogaden nationals participated in the demonstration .
Through a well-designed organization and strong spirit and zeal , the community members could score a resounding victory that will boost our morale and strengthen our unity while on the other hand will undermine the efforts of the enemy to further organize itself in the Diaspora . This victory will also function as a good example for the refugees who fled their country and are scattered all over the world to seek protection from persecution .
Since the Oromo community of the city of Melbourne in Victoria has a longstanding experience in dealing with such events , it will certainly follow them everywhere they go and disturb their scheduled meetings and force them to lose large sums of money they are spending to rent meeting halls .
WE are closely watching the attempts of underground agents to convene a meeting and try to mislead people .
What is most important is not the number of participants in the demonstration but the actions they take against the enemy with zeal and determination .
The OLF regional office in Victoria has performed a fruitful job , which will reflect unity of our community , and will uplift the Oromo liberation struggle , debase the enemy and put it to shame while it will make the Oromo and their friends proud as well as prepare them for a struggle that lays ahead of us .
The meeting convened by the enemy in Brunswick at 3:30 p.m . was disrupted by the youth and Oromo community of Melbourne .
The evil messengers , who were terrorized by actions taken against them by our people are found in Crown Plaza , located in the center of Melbourne .
They tried to intimidate the people by calling the police upon them .
Despite that , our heroes were able to occupy seats before the meeting was started .
Even though the event was in the news of the different mass media , we do not believe that they will stop organizing similar meetings .
As the enemy will not give up its efforts , it is of paramount importance to watch their footsteps until they give up hope and leave .
It is necessary to abort their attempts to spread evil seeds among the people .
Therefore , Oromo people must be alert and watch their actions .
On behalf of the Oromo Liberation found in Victoria , we hereby declare that we not only try to abort the mission of the enemy but also see to it that our community will do whatever is necessary and deploy ourselves to carry out any duties as effectively as possible .
To those of you who were subjected to persecution and fled the country but are presently serving the Wayanne regime in the Diaspora while forgetting that this regime has blood of the Oromo youth on its hand , we strongly advise you to refrain yourselves from such evil deeds or you will be exposed publicly .
It is a matter of top priority to expose those who fail to perceive the plight of their people , forget the reason as to why they fled the country but harbor themselves in a foreign country and serve the enemy in its endeavor to subjugate our people .
Otherwise , our people will not leave in peace as desired and its attainment will be questionable .
It is important to come to a collective agreement as to how our community will function in unity .
The reason for the necessity of this action is because they will exploit our weaknesses and proceed with their deception .
We strongly urge those who knowingly or unintentionally work in close collaboration of the enemy , that commits atrocities and violates the human rights of our people , to refrain themselves from their deeds .
Otherwise , the blood of our you spilt by the enemy will condemn you .
Beware also that history will judge you .
The OLF office in the Victoria zone believes inj the unity of the Oromo community .
We express our gratitude to the committee of the Victoria Oromo Community and the general Oromo people for your participation in this endeavor and making it successful .
As fighting is bound to Gadaa tradition . let us get ready to score victory in Oromiyaa .
Victory to the Oromo people !
OLF of the Victoia Zone .
TPLF's mission in Melbourne , Australia thwarted
On February 1 , 2015 and on January 31 , 2015 the Oromo community in Australia living in the city of Melbourne defeated a move by delegates of the enemy called OPDO by interrupting their work and making them cancel their planned meeting .; Abdulaziz Mohammed , Deputy Governor of Oromiya , was on a mission in Australia ,
In this demonstration , Amhara and Ogaden people were present .
Through unity and strength of community leaders , the victory of our community is glorious , and we say it strengthens our unity in the future and frustrates the enemy's attempt to organize itself abroad , and it is a lesson for all Oromos who fled to foreign countries to save their lives .
The Association of Oromo Community in Victoria that has people who know the area very well tracked down the envoys in the city of Melbourne and showed them that although they spend their money booking multiple halls , they cannot escape from the general public .
Their infiltrators who tried to organize themselves and confuse the public by trying to meet with their cliques in different places could not escape from the eyes of our public organization .
It is not the number of people that participated in that demonstration but the courage and determination they made to hinder the mission of the enemy that we are proud of .
OLF in Victoria District would like to emphasize that this success isthe deed that shows the unity of our community and lifts the victories of QBO ., Also it is a successful job that humiliated and ashamed the enemy:on the other hand , besides making the Oromos and friends proud of our struggle , it prepares them for the rest of our struggle .
The attempt by these delegates of the enemy to call a meeting at 03:00pm in a place called Brunswick in Melbourne to disturb the unity and to confuse our people was not successful .
The delegates who were terrified by the firm stand of our society tried to move their mission to the center of the city at Melbourne Crown Plaza .
they also tried to mobilize the police force for intimidation .
when they were , however , gathering , our heroes overtook them and disturbed their plans .
The plan to interrupt the mission of the enemy in Melbourne , Australia was reported in different media though we cannot say actions of the enemy in this region stop here .
Because the enemy does not give up , it is important to follow them until the team on the mission gives up and leaves this region .
It is important to stop their attempts to bring pain to our people and make them go back .
Therefore , every Oromo should strongly follow it up .
As Oromo Liberation Front of the Victoria district , we would like to also emphasize that we will not only interrupt this mission of the enemy but also our community is expected to continue marching for the remaining tough work .
We recommend either to recall and advise those fighters who fled this enemy yesterday though they did disregard the flowing of Oromo people's blood , by focusing on their own business , creating TPLF government strategy andbetraying their people today , or to expose and expel them from the community .
Today those who could not see the problem of their people , who have forgotten the reason they fled the country yesterday and hide here today to become the enemy's bridge for facilitating the mission of the enemy , will be exposed .
Otherwise we would like to emphasize and note that i the peace of our community will be disturbed and uncertain .
It is important to prioritize the mutual coexistence of our people in the future .
Because they can manipulate our weakness , it is necessary to note that doing this consistently in the future is inevitable .
We request those who were blinded by thierown business Intentionally or unintentionally , and armed by the enemy to inflict huge pain on your own peopleto stop your misdeeds .
You will be responsible for Oromo people's blood that is shaded fby the enemy you are dependening on .
Otherwise we would like you to know that you will not escape bearing historical responsibility .
Therefore , Victoria district OLF , generally , trusts the determination of the unity of the Oromo community .
For the success of this task , we thank teams in the Victoria Oromo community and the people of Oromo who participated in this demonstration .
Fighting district by district , let us stand to achieve victory in Oromiya as well .
Victory to the Oromo People !
Victoria District OLF
Oromom patriots were sacrificed while trying to celebrate the commemoration of Agarii Tulluu .
The photos you are looking at are those of young Oromo individuals , who could not tolerate the acts of the Wayanne against our people , thus took up arms and starting fighting with bravery but fell into the hands of Wayanne that committed barbaric and atrocious acts upon them and used it as a propaganda material to intimidate the people .
It is a great honor for the Oromo people to be sacrificed while killing and resisting their enemies .
This act of the fascist Wayanne was happened on 9/12/2014 in SALALEE zone and Darratii district .
It is reported these gallant Oromo youths chose to go to the bush , because they could not tolerate any more the torments , oppression and suppression Wayanne was committing upon the residents of that district .
After routing 4 Wayannee solders and several police men , this heroic and gallant individual by the name of KATAMMAA WUBETU fell into the hands of the enemy on9/2014 and was publicly hanged together with his colleague in Gondo town by Wayannee , Darra district which the enemy used as a show case for intimidation of the people .

OROMIYA SHALL BE FREE !!
Dufeeraa Braasaa : God in the Blue Sky
It is well known that our fathers and mothers say : God in the blue sky , the One with hundreds of names .
Since a while , some Oromo people associate the saying " God in the blue sky " with worshiping a false god .
There is only one God , who has many names .
The concept of " God in the blue ( dark ) sky " denotes for the Oromo people that " God is flawless ."
For example : 1 . I drink only blue water . 2 . I also prefer blue eyes .
Do not curse unborn babies in the " dark " wombs of their mothers . The phrase " blue ( dark ) sky " contained in " God in the blue ( Dark ) sky " depicts the true nature of God and does not refer to worshipping a false god .
God in the blue ( dark ) sky is the one that relives one from burdens , the bed rock of both the miserable and wealthy , the tower upon which a desperate and penniless man leans , flawless God in the blue ( dark ) sky with no needs , God is my father , He is the upright and is like lash grasses that grow upon towering mountains , you are the master over water springs . That is why I sing hymns to Thy name and uplift it , that is why I adore Your name , those who are not better than me suppressed and buried my knowledge by though being shrewd . Therefore , I started schooling , because their stupidity affected me . You provided me with bread from heaven when my livestock were wiped out by drought , and helped me raise my children . Why do they give me headache by saying I do not know God ? How do I not know the Unitary God with many names ?
Milk , curd , buttered and spicy barley cake and scrambled spicy bread , Hanchotte , porridge , flat bread and fries . Just like those proud individuals , I wish I could comprehend Thy being , while being satisfied with whatever I have , wish I could glorify Thy kindness . Pride befits only such mean beasts as aardvark and evil mind individuals . You provide me with everything , oh Father with abundance . Through Your hand craft , all plants grown and blossom , I raise up my hands and give thanks unto Thee . One may see bad dreams whenever one dozes , and one must drink tape worm medicine with determination though it is utterly bitter . Oh , merciful God do unto me anything that you think is good for me.============================ Dhufeeraa Birraasaa
Dufera Birasa :- Waka Gara Guracha
The saying Waka Gara Guracha , tokkicha maqaa dhibba is common among fathers and mothers who are alive and deceased .
However , since recent years , we hear that many of our Oromos abandoned and criticized the expression `Waka gara guracha ' like a made up God .
God is one , but his names are many .
For Oromo " Waka gara guracha ' means equivalent to `God with clean stomach .
For example : 1 . I did not drink anything except black water 2 . I will look at it again with black eye 3 .
Don't suspect a child with black stomach ; Hence , in `Waka gara guracha ' the phrase `gara guracha ' explains identity of God and not a made up God .
Waka Gara Guracha questioning human mind Problem solving God that rich and poor depend onHelpless poor does not break if fall onWaka gara guracha the clean without problemI sing because you are my father's God , owner of Straight Grass , owner of the hills , owner of the clean river bank I liked clarification of your name because of thisThose unaware excelled me brillianceBlocked and covered my eye of wisdomStarted learning when I don't knowA living foolishness turned to meWhen hunger affected my cattle badlyYou made your rain to fall and grew my childWhy do they trouble me saying I don't know GodHow don't I know you the one with hundred names ?
Milk , yoghurt , chuko and chachabsaAnchote , porridge , chumbo and burkumsaAs I learned your being God from my parentsI have the admiration of your goodnessProtect my home from burglars and thievesWhat you grew by your hand workI shall pay tribute to you with a bunch of fresh grassA bad dream sleeping by leaning on baqiiDrinking tenicide for suspicion of own stomachI wanted your stomach more than mineI called you God of clean stomach because of this ====================== Dufera Birasa

Residents of Ambo town were able to disable the evil plan that Wayannee attempted to implement for the third time .
June 22 , 2014 ( Qeeroo ) - The demands of the Oromo people for a rightful ownership of their country is being suppressed and their voices silenced by deployment of armed forces .
Wayanee's cadres are forcing residents of the Amboo town to participate in a Wayannee staged demonstration against the FXG ( RAS ) with the aim to undermine or if possible destroy it .
The enemy attempted to forcefully mobilize the people as well as use its cadres to participate in the costly and pro Wayannee demonstration . It even deployed a huge military force to enact this scheme in Amboo town
Wayannee tried to impose its hopeless machination upon our people by inviting a meeting in which not more than 100 people participated . Most of the participants were natives of Oromo but traitors who sold their souls cheaply while the rest were non-Oromo individuals who can speak the Oromo language .
Residents and Oromo youth of the Amboo town denounced those who participated in the meeting and considered them as declared enemies of the Oromo people .
In their attempt to condemn and resist the actions of fascist Wayannee , Oromo residents of county 03 of Amboo town were trying to hold a meeting in an elementary school located in Carii , but were overwhelmed by the armed forces encamped in Amboo town who abducted 6 Oromo students and threw them into the police prison of the western Shewa zone .
It has been made public that Wayannee is compelling the armed forces including the militia police unit located in this region to wear civilian clothes and appear as if they were ordinary people and partake in the demonstration though a considerable number is not willing to follow this enforcement .
It became clear that the attempts of Wayannee to mobilize traitor cadres and farmers by threatening them to either support its machination or they will be denied fertilizers failed through the resistance of urban and rural dwellers
Information we obtained showed that TPLF cadres , whose names were kept confidential , forced an individual by the name of Mootummaa and others , who work for the western Shewa administrative region , to convene a meeting . The nominal agenda regarded water , mineral and energy natural resources of Oromiyaa . Thus , the cadres gathered about 100 people in Ambo stadium , including regime loyalists , military personnel , the militia , police officers , some Oromo residents of Amboo town of western Shewa region , as well as other cadres who were forced to participate . The participants were watched over by a huge military force that surrounded the stadium .
Since Wayannee was not able to find tangible propaganda material to be casted on its TV , it started to jail its own cadres .
Because of this movement , Amboo town is surrounded by armed forces .
The savage and inhuman deeds committed by the enemy in Amboo town and its surroundings has angered the people so much that they have resolved to pay all necessary sacrifices .
Because Wayannee is so much worried about the resistance of the Amboo Oromo youth and people that it is compelled to mobilize Oromo traitors as well as individuals of other ethnic origin , and use these as a tool to create a disunity among the residents of the town .
It has been reported that Oromo residents of western Shewa , Amboo town and its surroundings have resolved to resist any future of Wayannee and boycott it by all ways and means possible .
TPLF's attempt to conduct 3[rd ] round conspiracy on Ambo City was foiled by the Oromo people and youth in Ambo city .
e June 22 , 2014 ( Youth ) - the Propaganda of the TPLF government is disturbing the peace of the people by creating a language logo to divert Oromo people's long standing question for land ownership and by suppressing the voices of the oppressed people using weapons and armed forces .
This way it was trying to undermine the FDG in West Shoa , Ambo by forcing people to demonstrate in support of the TPLF government through its cadres .
It was prepared to conduct forced demonstration of people and its cadres allocating a huge budget and mobilizing a large number of armed forces to perform conspiracy of enmity against the city of Ambo,but the plan of TPLF and their officials was foiled by the resistance of the Oromo youth .
It is observed that TPLF organized a meeting of not more than 100 persons composed of their selfish cadres and those who are non-Oromo except speaking Oromo language to conduct hopeless conspiracy against our people .
Specially Oromo people living in the city of Ambo and all Oromo youth showed the hate they have against TPLF by not taking part in this conspiracy of the enemy saying that participating in the TPLF's call is being an enemy of the Oromo people .
Oromo youth and the Oromo people in city of Ambo,district 03 , around Chariti elementary school condemned and stood against this fascist act of TPLF ; The gathering of the protesters was dispersed by the army settled in the city of Ambo ; 6 Oromo youth were caught by the armed forces and thrown into jail in West Shoa police station .
In these activities of the TPLF government , the army was forced to change its uniform and resemble the people to take part in TPLF's demonstration ; similarly , the militia and police were also directed to implement this without their will . As a result , internal information has leaked .
In addition , this hopeless TPLF gathered nations and nationalities living in the countryside . The selfish TPLF cadres from the countryside fooled the people by saying you will get fertilizer.When the Oromo people in the rural cities recognize TPLF's malice and resist , it can be observed that it is trying to disseminate propaganda to fool these nationalities .
The officials and TPLF agents who gain benefits by staging demonstrations in support of TPLF and the Minister of Water , Irrigation and Electricity , Motuma Makasa , and intimidated the people of West Shoa Zone as ordered by him ; similarly these cadres who are members of the army , militia , police force , gathered the people of Ambo , West Shoa zone , by force and about 100 cadres in Ambo stadium which was surrounded by a huge number of security forces , and gave a TPLF propaganda speech aginst the Oromo people ..

The currently ongoing Oromo struggle is similar the Oromo struggle during the 16[th ] hundreds .
February 25 , 206 in Oromia .
It was prior to the Oromo people's movement in the 16 hundred when Ahmed Giraany also invaded the region that the Abyssinian colonialists could buy modern military weapons ( guns ) from abroad and maintain their military superiority .
History shows that Galaawudiyoos could obtain military hard ware , 400 Maskeettos and 400 fighters from Portugal .
The Habashaa colonialist obtained not only armaments from abroad , but also military engineers ( handling of guns , firing of guns , etc .), medical personnel , advisors and mercenaries .
Since that time , the Abyssinian colonialist consider gun as a means of acquiring and maintain power , for robbery and livelihood .
In an Abyssinian society , it is a tradition that every male must carry a gun which is considered as a symbol and central piece of manhood .
During the 16[th ] hundreds when the Abyssinians were fighting among themselves , the Oromo people did not possess modern military weapons of any kind .
During that time ( the Oromo people ) did not have the means by which it could buy weapons from outside .
At that time , the Oromo utilized only traditional military weapons such as spears , bows and arrows , shields and horses .
History shows how the Oromo people who did not have any modern weapons were able to somehow defeat an enemy that was well armed with Maskeetto and tanks .
The single most important weapon of the Oromo nation during the 16th hundreds was the unity of its people .
Under the Gadaa system , the structure of unity stretches/extends from border to border .
It is possible to say that the Oromo society was organized based on a military system .
The Oromo military was structured on three levels of age group regiments .
These are first , Gadaa religious leaders that consists of Gadaa age group of 40-48 years old .
Second , the Qondaalaa group ( 32-40 age group )
This second group is known in general as the warrior class .
The third group is called Qeerroo or bachelor's group .
This apprentice or junior class in the age group of 24-32 years .
Thus , any male above the age of 24 years can be considered as a military conscript ready to fight at any time .
At times when the Oromo land is invaded by an enemy or in times when the people are under any threat the Gadaa leaders will announce a general mobilization of the warriors .
In addition , the other reason as to why Oromo had military superiority was due its mastery of horsemanship .
Let alone the Abyssinians even such super powers as Zuuluu and Fulaanii did not have the knowledge of using horses during that time .
Furthermore , the Oromo military was tactful , well-coordinated , of good moral standing and high discipline .
In his memoire , a military officer from Portugal by the name of Castanhonso who used to fight the Oromo on behalf of the Absyinians wrote " the size and quality of the Oromo military is immense ; the military strategy was not that of a backward people who march roam around as if they are going to a market place , but was grouped on squadron basis ; and once they are engaged in the war they fight strategically ".
Generally , during the 16[th ] hundreds the Oromo people were to able to ward off and defeat their enemy not because they possessed modern weapons , but because of their deep knowledge of warfare , iron discipline , good morale principles and most of all a strong unity .
The Oromo military was highly disciplined , because it was guided by the democratic Gadaa leadership .
It used to respect the human rights of war prisoners .
It did not oppress the people it defeated .
It did not feed itself by robbing other people .
On the other hand , the Abyssinian colonialist regime was built through the efforts of its miserable and criminal solders , who invaded and robbed our country .
that is why it was defeated at the end .
we perceive at the moment that a similar phenomenon is ongoing with the revolutionary Oromo movement .
The Wayanne military is an outlaw that carries out mass execution and advances the robbery committed by Wayannee .
it is a fascist army that is killing ordinary people and carrying out mass massacre everywhere .
feeling confident about itself due to its military superiority , it is committing horrendous and heinous crimes .
The Oromo people are currently resisting in unison from comer to corner the invasion of a highly armed group , who is robbing its property and killing its citizens .
we are observing that it is marching forward to get rid of the enemy that has kept it under yoke for a period of over 25 years .
is scoring victories .
The system organized youngsters , adults , the elderly , male , female , farmers and workers in a very disciplined manner and mobilized them from east to west , north to south and was able to defeat the enemy by simply using traditional weapons .
By saying we are armed and not disarmed , the people are in the process of disarming the enemy .
Certainly , the Oromo liberation movement is just like an ebbing stream .
The discipline , coordination and tactics being used is mature and very amazing .
Abyssinians who are currently in power as well as those who lost their power are suspicious of and worrid about what the Oromo movement might bring along .
They say that the way Oromo is acting becomes worrisome .
Hence , the Oromo people are in the process of being a mighty military power house not only in the that empire but also on the Horn Africa .
That is why we are saying that the present liberation movement of the Oromo people is similar to the revolution conducted during the 16[th ] hundreds .
Even if the enemy has the advantage in deploying all sorts of weaponry such war planes , helicopters , tanks it would not be able to score victory .
No weapon would ever wipe out a nation , as we learn from history .
There is no doubt whatsoever that the Oromo struggle will close its chapter by scoring a resounding victory .
Unity of the Oromo people is our strength !
We will be victorious !
Victory to the Oromo people !
The Oromo Liberation Movement that is kicked off is similar to that of the Oromo Movement of the 16[th ] century .
February 25 , 2016 in Oromiya
Importing guns that were obtained either through buying and/or support and transported through Chali Habashe was started during the time of Ahmed Giragn war in the first half of the 16[th ] century .
History remembers that Gelawudios received guns via support , 400 Masketo and 400 soldiers , from Portugal .
At that time , the Habesha forceful ruling system was importing not only the military equipment but also operators who could operate the accessories well , gun shooters and the like , advisors , and mercenaries ; and they had been importing them along with the military equipment .
Since that time , the Habesha forceful ruling system used the guns or military equipment as the source of their political power , tool of robbery and source of their life .
All Habesha families consider buying guns and arming their sons as part of their culture before anything else .
On the other hand , during that time , the Oromo people had massive confrontations with the Habeshas in the 16[th ] century ; theypossessed modern explosive military equipment , ranging from small to big guns .
At that time , there was no way for them to import the explosive military equipment from abroad .
The Oromo people were using traditional military equipment like a spear , strong stick , shield and horse .
The question of how the Oromos gained victory over their enemy without possessing the modern military equipment and by using only some Masketo and Medfiraised debates among the history writers .
The primary source of strength for the Oromo movement of the16[th ] century was the strong unity of the people .
It had a strong system under the Gada system that can enable them to make movements from border to border .
It is possible to say that the whole Oromo people was organized into military systems .
The Oromo military force was organized from three age sets to various regiments .
These are ; the first one encompasses Gada Priests ( those are in the Gada level of 40-48 years old ).
The second type is a group of Chiefs ( this encompasses the Gada level age group of 32-40 ).
Generally , the second level is commonly known with the name warrior class .
The third type ismade of the bachelors .
This category includes the apprentice or junior warrior class and it encompasses the Gada level of 24-32 years old .
Based on this , in the Oromo people , it means that all the persons strong enough for the war , that means those 24 years old and above , were all soldiers .
When the enemy invaded Oromo or when they start wars at the population level , these classes are guided by Gada Leaders within the already existing structure and there is general mobilization .
In addition , among the victory that Oromo had , onewas attributed to the use of cavalry .
At that time , let alone the Habeshas , even the peoples like Zulu and Fulanis who were known for their strong government didn't know about cavalry .
In addition , the Oromo military groups knew the science of war and had ethics , systems and unity of war .
Even the Portugal war chief named Castanhonso , who was grouped with the Habeshas and fighting against the Oromos said , " The Oromo military force was massive in number and tactic . At that time , all Oromo soldiers did not move together as in a market like that of uncivilized countries , instead they moved in the squadron as in modern war tactic . When they enter into the war , they held strategic places in teams and they fought ."
All in all , in the 16[th ] centuries the Oromos were able to win their enemy who was equipped with the modern military equipment . This wasn't because they possessed modern explosive military tools , but it was because it was built on war tactics , ethics and great cause ; and happen in mass and unity .
As the administration of Oromo Gada System was democratic , the Oromo military troops move with strong ethics .
When they surrender their enemy and take hostages , they don't abuse their human rights .
They don't threaten the people they won victory over .
They don't rob things from the community .
On the contrary , the Habesha military troops , which were made of poor people and criminals , rob from the community and consume , they were unethical .
Thus , they were defeated at the end .
When we come to the Oromo Liberation Movement , which is currently coming up by the vast Oromo people , we are able to witness similar things .
The EPDRF military force is deviant and kills civilians in mass with no reason and it is unethical . It is the demonstration of the robbing agenda of the EPRDF .
It is a fascist troop who kills travelling people everywhere and it is killing in mass .
It does take harsh measures on the peaceful Oromo people mercilessly as it believes in the rule of military ammunitions it possesses .
On the other side , the Oromo population as a nation is in unison from border to border and is confronting the military force of the enemy who is possessing modern military tools and who is campaigning against and killing them .
We can see that the nation is organized and move in determination to take away the regime which has been threatening it for 25 years .
And it is gaining success .
The youth , adults and elders , male and female , farmers and general employees and the whole segments of the Oromo community from North to South , East to West , are acting in unity with determination against the enemy using no weapons , but using the traditional military tools it possesses .
They are saying that they don't give their guns and that they take it instead ; and as a result , they are confronting the enemy with courage and taking the guns .
Frankly speaking , the Oromo Liberation Movements became as vast as the ocean and flooding over .
The ethics , organization and tactics being utilized are very mature and it is amazing .
Thus , not only the Habeshas having the political power , but also the ones who were demoted from their power and who are against the system to get back their power are fearing the situations of Oromo movement and are worried about what is going to come .
They are talking about how the Oromo Movement is terrifying .
This way , the Oromo people is showing that it is powerful not only in the empire but also in the Horn of Africa .
Thus , that is why we say that the current and growing Oromo liberation movement is becoming similar to that of the 16[th ] century Oromo movement .
Even if the enemy is armed to the teeth , no airplane and helicopter , no tank and artillery can win the power of the people .
In history , there is no shell and bullet that was able to terminate the existence of a population .
Thus , there is no doubt that the growing Oromo liberation movement will end up victorious with purpose .
Let the Unity of Oromo population be strengthened .
We shall win !
Victory for Oromo Population

Short statement of Qeerroo Oromo of June 1 , 2015 for the consumption of the general Oromo people regarding the election conducted by Wayanne in 2015 as well as on current situations prevailing in the country . This short statement regards the false and pretentious election staged by Wayanne EPRDF regime , the continuous support FDG ( RAS ) receives from the general Oromo people and what steps the Oromo people need to take in unison .

The demands forwarded by the Qubee generation of the Qubbee Oromo liberation movement regarding ownership of our country including questions about the right to freedom and liberty has been well received by Oromo nationals living within the country as well as in the Diaspora .
We will pay with our dear life .
This movement is geared towards opposing the schemes of the enemy , namely the so called " Master Plan ", whose principal objective is forceful garbing of land found in Finfinnee and its surroundings . Our movement has shaken up the enemy .
It is a must that we show to the barbaric Wayanee regime that the revolutionary movement is being waged since almost one year will continue unabated regardless of possible arbitrary arrest , mass execution and dismissal from schools and working places .
Qeerro for the Liberation of Oromo ( QBO ) demands that in the total absence of democratic principle but gross violations of human rights are rampant , the propaganda aired by Wayanne that it is holding a fair and free election must be stopped .
Qerroo is in the process of staging a protest FDG ( RAS ) in unison with the Oromo people against the false and pretentious election held by Wayanne EPRDF on Sunday , May 24 , 2015 .
Furthermore , we want to tell the enemy that the Oromo people want to live in peace and harmony in a liberated Oromiyaa .

People living in Jiituu/Guyii town of Haaruu district of eastern Wallgaa zone claim that the result of the election in which they participated has been rigged .
Qeeroo repot from Guyii town of May 25/2015 : By covertly assembling individuals who oppose the movement for liberation of the Oromo people and those who identifythemselves as Oromo but stand against the Oromo , the dictatorial regime is broadcasting in the media that this year's election is going to be democratic , free and fair . Thus , beliving that what is stated is true , we obtained our election cards , queued up and voted the candidate of our own choice who we thought will represent us in the party . ALAS ! IT IS STOLEN ! In the Guyii town , Haaruu district of eastern Wallaggaa , by two people : The people revolted claiming that their voice was rigged by Zarihun Tamasgeen Tarfaasaa and Abboomaa Magarsaa .
These two individuals are already known for opposing Oromo patriotism , for their consideration of persons who advocated for human rights as criminals and turned them over to their masters , and who also betrayed and exposed our children who grew up in the spirit of Oromo nationalism . Right now , they sold to Wayanne the ballots the people rightfully casted . People surely know what the outcome of the election is .

Oromiyaa Protest Demonstration
WASHINGTON , DC ( VOA Afaan Oromoo ) - The Finfinnee university students from different campuses came together and staged a demonstration on March 8 , 2016 infront of the Embassy of the United States
It is to be remembered that the United States gives large amount of assistance to Ethiopia .
Students reported to the Voice of America radio that protest started in opposition to the Finfinnee Master Plan . It has now a new dimension with demonstrations being staged for the last three months whose objectives regard other issues .
In an attempt to disperse the demonstrating Finfinnee students , drastic measures were taken against them . As a consequence , many were wounded , others suffered broken bones and more than fifty students were jailed .
Though we marched wearing white clothes as a sign of peace , yet serious measures were taken against us claim the students .
Based on rumors we heard that many students were jailed in Gullallee , we made a phone call which nobody picked up .
to the questions posed to the regime cadres by Reuters regarding the demonstration held by university students , the officials ' reply was that the issue does not deserve a response .

February 19 , 2016 : Qeerroo.org
As of February 19 , 2016 , the Wayane regime has put strict pressure on medical doctors who it suspects are supporters or sympathizers of the cause of their people .
As a result , it has become impossible to give medical service to the people .
4 doctors from the reference hospital , whose names are :
Dr Biqilaa Nagasaa ( Internist ) 2 . Dr Shimallis Laggasaa ( Internist ) 3 . Dr Taddasee sooressoo ( pediatrician ) 4 . Dr Tashomee Abayinee(pediatrician ) have been forbiddeb by the medical director to practice any kind of private services .
Employees of the hospital say that this kind of action will deny the doctors an opportunity to earn a decent living .
In association with present condition , this colonialist regime is trying its best to hurt the Oromo People .
The affected doctors are appealing to the concerned authority to reconsider their cases .
The perpetration of extra judicial killings , arbitrary arrests coupled with its failure to meet the basic needs of the people and now mishandling medical doctors will all enhance the struggle for justice . The people have nowhere to turn to and get any type of help .

Ethnic cleansing is being carried out on shanyii clan of Anniyyaa Oromo .
#untranslated
#‎Oromo Protests‬ Ethnic cleansing is being carried out on Anniyyaa Oromo people.‬
As we all know Wayannee is doing all it can to create conflicts between the Oromo people and other ethnic groups .
This kind of conflict is happening around Afar region , Baalee and in Gaara Mulata in a place called Anniyyaa where the devil Wayannee always instigates conflicts and clashes between the Oromo and other ethnic groups .
The reason why Wayannee does this is to create misunderstanding between the Oromo and others and buy its own time to rule in peace and to function as a go between peace maker .
Aniyyaa is a very tough area .
This region is not accessible by vehicle as there are no roads , but is an area where the armed liberation movement obtained its munitions .
The Somali special police force , heavily armed by Wayannee started to invade Aniyyaa and took people's lands , killed many people , burned down the whole village and looted properties .
As the Oromo people were disarmed , they were not able to defend themselves ad were wiped out by the Somali police .
It is a matter of top urgency that Oromo people must seek means and ways of helping the Aniyyaa Oromo .
Diaspora Oromo People must seek means of aiding the Aniyyaa Oromo as urgently as possible .
Oromo at home must and organize themselves to help the Aniyyaa people as well as exert pressure on the regime so that it stops siding with the Somali police .
Those Oromo nationalists who are working for the regime in different capacities be it as a police man , a militia and others should recognize your responsibilities to help the affected Oromo of Aniyyaa and be watchful of the tactics Wayannee uses to create conflicts . Through this message , we would like to make you aware of your national duties and responsibility to save the lives of the affected people .
Those living in the Diaspora should publish this information and make it available to all others concerned .
It is also important not to fall into Wayannee snares and traps of clashing with our neighbors , but to resolve any differences peacefully .
Those Oromo in the Diaspora should form committees together with people from our neighboring countries and find ways and means of resolving any differences that might arise by studying he root cause of the issues , pass joint statements , and if possible stage a jointly organized demonstration .
Oromo people at home should join hands with our neighbors and try to live peacefully .
The problems we are talking about are symbols slavery , and uprooting it is the foundation for liberation .
Therefore , the only solution to our problem are : Oromo should wake up , be organized , establish a strong leadership from amongst you , initiate a strong organization , build up a strong military .
The struggle will continue !!!
Via Daraaraa Sabaa OMN : eastern Haragee Qumbii district 16 people killed #‎Oromo protests‬ OMN : News July 11,2016 in a place called Qumbii , eastern Hararge zone , the Somali special police killed 16 people and wounded 6 others as reported by mass media.‬
Their properties were looted and people fled their from homes .
It is known that the Somali special police , armed and trained by the Ethiopian military has been taking action at many places in eastern Haragee .
The Special fore was crossing the Oromyaa border illegally , but this time it is carrying arbitrary killing of innocent people .
A couple of days ago , war broke out between the Oromo people and Special police force in Qumbii whereby 16 people were killed and a lot of properties were looted by the special police .
People caught up in the warfare had to leave their homes and flee for their lives .
Residents of Qumbii said that the warfare that started three days ago has been going on continuously .
The Ethiopian regime is covertly participating in the fighting people claim .
A total number of 16 people have been killed by the Somali police out of which 16 bodies have been put to rest .
The individual who told the story sadly said the dead body of one individual has been eaten by hyena in the yard where the body was left .
Due to the atrocities perpetrated against us by the Ethiopian regime we were even not be able to bury our dead said the people .
A lot of our properties have been robbed .
We are forced to leave the place of our birth and flee for our lives .
They say that during the time when the Somali special force is invading our area there was nobody who came to our rescue .
We asked one individual as to why war is going on in Qumbii .
This individual told us the war is being waged in a place called Minno , in Qumbii district .
The individual who talked to us said that the issue has become a matter of concern . He said the place is a border town where a Federal police force is stationed . During the time when were attacked by Somali police the Federal police did not come to our rescue , but instead claimed that the Somali police force has crossed the border , because the Federal police told them to do so .
He went on and said not only were people killed on their own territory but also that the Oromiyaa border is being violated .
During the three days of warfare , the Somali special police could penetrate 40 kilo meters into Oromiya territory and capture a large piece of Oromo land .
It is reported the person who calls himself governor of Oomiyaa did not attempt a bit to seek solution to the problem
The police force is trained and supplied with heavily armaments by the Ethiopian regime and deployed to kill the innocent Oromo people .
It still goes on .
Having an expansionist policy the special police has looted enormous property of the people .
The warfare displaces many people who had to flee for their lives .
The residents sad that nobody came to their rescue .
On several occasions , the militia being supported by the Ethiopian regime has crossed the eastern Harargee border and carried out fights . However , this time is a very serious situation say residents of the town .

#Oromo Protests Anniya Oromos are facing mass homicide .
As we all understand , there is no tree that the EPRDF doesn't climb and there is no mountain that it doesn't mount on to incite conflict between the Oromo and other nationalities .
On the way to Mi'eso , around Afar , Bale as well as on the way to Mul'ata mountain around Anniya , most of the time , the sons of the imp , EPRDF , are trying to instigate conflict between the Oromo and other nationalities .
If we ask why this happens , they just want to create conflict between the Oromo and other peoples to divert the protest that the Oromo is undertaking and then to create a space for themselves to live without being challenged by trying to resolve the conflict .
The current one around Anniya is very harsh .
As you can understand , this area is a place where there is no road infrastructure and a place where many Oromos reside ; and it was known for its save haven for the Oromo movement .
Now the EPDRF fully equipped the Somali force which is called Special police force and it is displacing most of the Oromos from the land , killing many people , burning villages and robbing properties .
Here , they unarmed the Oromos beforehand by collecting the guns back so that they remain defenceless ; the Somali Special police , which is supported by the EPDRF , is moving freely and it is killing our people .
Thus it is necessary that the Oromos in the neighboring areas need to discuss quickly on how to assist these people .
Our Oromo brothers and sisters who are residing in foreign countries , it is good to discuss on how to assist these people by coming together quickly .
Oromo in the homeland too , it is very good to create pressure in an organized manner on the government to make them stop the situation and to prepare ways on how to help them .
Oromo people and people who are working for the government , police officers , military forces , and all of you , it is a must to help these Oromos . In addition , discussing amongst yourselves on how to abort the act that EPRDF is trying to incite conflict between the Oromo and other nationalities and to stop the killing of our people , which is your patriotic duty , be aware of this .
For the Oromo people abroad , it is good to make this issue goes public on social media and discuss , share the information and make the world hear about it .
Though the EPRDF is trying to create conflict between the Oromo and other nationalities , we need to work on how to manage it without getting ourselves in that situation and without having ourselves got into conflict with the neighboring nations and nationalities .
For the Oromos abroad , it is good to discuss the issue with the nations and nationalities of our neighbors like the Ogaden , Afar and others ; discussing the issue at community level , making them understand the problem , issuing a joint statement and , if possible , staging demonstration together .
Again the Oromos in the homeland too need to work on the issue peacefully with the neighboring nations .
In addition , all the problems we are talking about are signs of slavery and the solutions are the path to liberty .
Thus for the Oromos to be awake , get organized , have a strong leader , establishing a strong organization and build a strong forces are the best options .
The struggle will continue !!!

Campaign against imprisonment and the Master Plan
#untranslated
The dictatorial Wayanne regime , which is determined to implement the Finfinnee Master Plan at the beginning of the Abyssinian new year , is now hauling many students into parsons , because it suspects that Oromo students might agitate the mass against its scheme .
SBO ( Voice of the Oromo Liberation ) news reports the regime is imprisoning many students in the assumption that they might agitate patriotic other patriotic and gallant students to protest the planned Finfinnee Master Plan during the new year .
According to information obtained from SBO , the Wayanee regime is presently harassing and imprisoning many Oromo students in the assumption that , heeding the call the OLF , might agitate Oromo patriots and other students to protests against the Master Plan .
So far , the regime has arrested 9 Oromo students in Horo Jimmaa Gannatii district , Amboo town , Finfinnee , Sabbataa and put them in prison , because it claims that the students wer agitating the masses to oppose the Mater Plan in the name of the OLF .
Thus , on September 3 , 2015 five Oromo studnets whose names are Nugusee Biraanuu , Iyyaasuu Tashoomaa , Miimmii Guddataa , Namee Dhadhaloo and Garramuu Fayyeeraa were arrested in Horro Jimmaa Gannatii were imprisoned in that district's jail , while students Tarressaa Nagarii abd Fioomsaawere jailed in Amboo town , and from around Sabbataa in Finfinnee students Taayyee Harqinaa and Mangistuu Sarbeessaa were arrested on September 8 , 2015 and jail at the " third police prison " and are being tortured .
To implement its Master Plan project , the enemy is imprisoning and intimidating the Oromo , trying to cut Oromiyaa into pieces and thus to destroy the identity , history and culture of the Oromo people . However , Oromo patriots opposed similar scheme during the year 2014 and vows to do the same this time also .
Qeerroo for the Liberation of the Oromo people hereby calls upon all Oromo nationals found in Oromityaa and outside of Oromiyaa to stand up and resist the implementation of the Finfinnee Master Plan .
Mass arrest and the Finfine Master Plan
#untranslated
The autocratic EPRDF government is imprisoning the Oromo students who it suspects for mobilizing the community against the system right before it announces that it is going to implement it in the Habeshas ' New Year .
Related to that the Master Plan is planned by the EPRDF government to divide Oromiya and to displace the Oromo people from their land and it is said by the system to be implemented in the new year of Habeshas ' and at this time when the protest by the Oromo people has become widespread , the sources of SBO verified that the government is incarcerating courageous Oromos , who are thought to have organized the people and students and mobilize them against the system .
As the SBO sources made it clear , in the Habeshas ' new year before the Finfine City Master plan is implemented , the autocratic EPRDF government started imprisoning Oromo peoples , including students in Oromiya at various places , those it suspects that they could mobilize the Oromo against the system by telling them that they accepted the OLF duty and are going to incite violence .
Our sources made it clear that as such more than 9 Oromo students from Ona Horro Jimma Gennati , Ambo town and Finfine City around Sebeta area are jailed and tortured for working with the OLF and mobilizing the community against them and obstruct the implementation of the Finfine Master Plan via violence .
In the same manner , on September 03 , 2015 , five Oromo students from Ona Horro Jimma Gennati whose names are Nuguse Birhanu , Iyasu Teshome , Mimi Gudeta , Name Dhadalo and Geremu Feyera at Onicha Police station , from Ambo town whose names are Teresa Negeri and Firomsa on September 05 , 2015 at Ambo town Police station as well as from Finfine City Sebeta area the Oromo students whose names are Taye Harkina and Mengistu Serbesa on September 08 , 2015 at the prison of Finfine city called " Sostegna Police station '' and it is revealed that they are jailed at these stations and that they are among the ones who are being tortured .
It continued the mass arrest in a strengthened manner at various places of Oromiya to split Oromiya via the Master plan and to make the Oromos landless , and to eradicate its culture , history and identity , and even if the system announced to implement the plan , the Oromo population protested against it in public and prevented its implementation through sacrifice like in 2014 . Again , the Oromo braves reminded that it is continuing the protest and opposition in a strong manner .
It is in memory that Young Person of Oromo Liberation made a call for Oromo people to value the sacrifice paid for the sake of the Oromo people to get a hold of land of their ancestors and their general rights and to stand strong in unity inside and outside in the opposition of Finfine Master Plan which is being said to be implemented .

Patriotic Oromo students and supporters of the Oromo struggle are being intimidated and kidnapped .
To maintain its regime , the Wayanee group is kidnapping and intimidating very patriotic Oromo students of exceptional leadership quality . The whereabouts of many is not known . This has become serious , because the Wayane regime thinks that these students are organizing people's protest specially during the time when the regime is intending to hold an election .

According a report of Oromedia from Finfinnee , armed Tigre soldiers arrested on June 9 , 2016 Mr . Zalaalam Jamaane , who oversaw Agriculture Office of Oromiyaa regional state .
Up to the time he was detained , he was under surveillance and was followed up .
Mr . Zalaalam was detained , because it is alleged that during the time he was active in working in the government office as an OPDO officer , he was using his power to amass gains he was not entitled to
Even so , people who have known the case closely allege that his dismissal was due to a conflict he ah with the then President of Oromiyaa , Mktaar Kadir .
I addition , a fellow by the name of Diroo Damme who was Mayo of Sulultaa town was detained , because he is suspected of amassing large tracts of land under his name and relatives .
The Oromiyaa regional assembly , which is being commanded by the Tigress , had its meeting of June 8 , 2016 denied to Mr . Zalaalam and Mr . Dirro their rights to a review of their respective cases .
Oromo patriots call upon OPDO members saying g now is the right time to stand with the Oromo people and join the struggle for the liberation of the Oromo county .
Two OPDO members are jailed
( Oromedia , Finfine , 10 June , 2016 ) Two OPDO members are imprisoned due to corruption . But , it is being told that the imprisoning of these two OPDO members is on political basis .
Zelalem Jemane - Reporter of Oromedia from Finfine reported that on June 9 , 2016 Obbo Zelalem Jemana who has been serving as Head of Oromiya Agricultural Bureau with the rank of deputy president , is arrested under the disguise of corruption by Tigray militias .
It is also known that he was being followed and captured by the forces until the day he was arrested .
Obbo Zelalem , OPDO's member of the polity bureau , was jailed for gaining unlawful benefit by abusing his power as a government official .
But insiders say that his imprisonment is from the result of the disagreement that he previously had with the Oromiya President , Muktar Kedir .
In addition , it is revealed that the previous Mayor of Sululta town , Obbo Diro Dame was arrested as he was suspected of taking lots of lands both in his name and his relatives ' name .
Even if the council of Oromiya region is being ruled by Tigres , they called an urgent meeting on June 8 , 2016 to pass a decision on this matter , and we do remember that , they lifted the immunity of Obbo Zelalem and Obbo Diro .
The Courageous Oromos have call on the OPDO members to join the Oromo struggle by understanding the current situation make a historical contribution to make sure the Oromo people gain their rights and independence .

Several students of Wallaggaa university were arrested because of the intensification of protest movement .
December 1 , 2016 : The protests taking place in the campus of Wallaggaa university against the dictatorial governance has been going on for one whole month and several Oromo university students were kidnapped .
The consistent demonstration going on in the entire region of Oromiyaa has confused and unnerved the regime so much that it is now arresting many university students who struggle for the freedom of their people .
These students were alleged to hav instigated the ongoing protest in the university campus and were kidnapped and their whereabout is unknown .
Moreover , eight students were kidnapped and their whereabout is not known while four others were also kidnapped and supposedly jailed in an unknown address .
The person spearheading the jailing of university students is a Tigre named Rabbirraa Asaffaa Kelqay , who is the commander of the campus police .

2 . Student Sabboonaa Caalchisaa , whose birth place is Shaambuu of eastern Wallggaa , and 4[th ] year student of civil engineering .
Despite intensification of jailing and kidnapping of Wallaggaa university students , the FXG ( revolutionary movement against slavery ) has been strengthened . Reports reaching us from the university indicate that the struggle by the students has gained momentum despite killings and kidnappings .
The phot of kidnapped Wallaggaa university student Keeraaj Mootummaa is shown herewith .
As the FXG Wollega University students continued many students are being arrested by TPLF force .
December 1 , 2016 , related to the ending slavery protest that is going on for the whole month in the compound of the Wollega University , news reached us from the Young Person from the compound that explain that the Oromo students of the university are being taken away and disappeared .
The tyrannous and falling government is highly irritated by the protest that is taking place in Oromiya nationwide and as it is highly confused about what to do , it is continuing to capture and disappear the Oromo people who are courageous for their people from the compound .
Related with the nationwide protest undergoing in the Wollega university , the Oromo students are being taken away and their whereabouts is not known for allegedly leading the fxg in the Wollega University .
Still now , in all the compounds of the Wollega university , there are Oromo students who are arrested and thought guilty only for being Oromo and as such there are 8 who disappeared . It is also revealed that they are looking for other four students to jail them .
The man who is preaching the notion of one nation and helping the federal police in the arrest and killing of the students of the university is the head of the police force of the compound and his name is Rebbira Assefa Kelkay , he is also identified to be a Tigre .
Among the students who are taken away from the university and whose whereabouts is unknown are : 1 . Student Kerak Motuma , his home town is West Shewa Zone Ambo District and he is a 4th year Civil Engineering student of Wollega University .
2 . Student Sabona Calchisa , his home town is East Wollega Zone Shambu town . He is a 4th year Civil Engineering student of Wollega University .

The students of the university said that killing and incarcerating strengthens the Oromo struggle and there is no going back ; and our sources from the Young Person from the Wollega University explained that they are continuing their protests .
Among the photos of the students who disappeared from the compound of Wollega University , we have gotten the photo of student Keraj Motuma .

Listen attentively to this complete report .
The victory the Oromo people was able to score over the past eight months cannot be considered as petty issue .
By : Jawar Mohammed People who are observing what our neighbors are doing should not belittle what people have achieved over the last eight months .
Therefore , it is important to remind each other about one or two points .
1 . Why should people say that Oromo did not kill an enemy ..... is it because the Oromo did not show off ?
Don't you remember that even the regime has said it openly that it lost many fighters ?
If you want the truth , you need to study what type of deeds have been accomplished at Cillimoo forests , Mogor river , Shaaallaa and Gaara Mul'ataa mountains . You need the history .
Around a place called Gaalesaa in eastern Shewa , young men disarmed the enemy and fought off a special commando unit sent by Wayannee for a period of two months till they ran short of munition . Do you know about it ?
How many have forgotten the brave Oromo woman who knocked off an Agazii soldier by hitting him on the head with a pestle and took away his gun ?
Our people stopped using gun to kill and brag about it , not because there are no guns available .
Even if they are simple fire arms , our people have them .
If their ae no guns already at home , we have proven that we disarm the enemy and capture hundreds of guns .
It was a strategy of a military commander to enter a fight carrying guns .
Killing an enemy in a struggle might make one feel glorious , and revealing your strategy for a successful , warfare and just like exposing yourself to danger and thus has no use .
If our people , without being organized and strategy , had taken up arms and stared fighting , their efforts would have not lasted for even a week let alone for eight months .
We would have not enjoyed the victories we ae able to score up to now .
Therefore , do not forget to alert our people not to bear war armaments .
The Oromo saying goes as : Do not take out your spears if you are not going to war .
2 . What happened in Gondar also happened in Shashamanee . They look similar .
Forces sent by Tigres killed armed forces of the local government .
If you remember , it was the Oromo police and armed forces of Oromiya that wiped out the federal forces that carried out killings in Shashamanee .
3 . To wage a successful struggle , it is necessary to balance its intensity with sustainability .
If you do not concentrate on the struggle with all you might and bring it down to earth quickly , you will simply waste your energy .
As our struggle has gone through several trial periods , it was able to be sustained over eight months period .
The Oromiyaa movement did away with fear and even emboldened our neighbors .
The persistent of the struggle for the solid eight months made other areas to be brave and adopt the strategy .
They learned all kinds of tactics from Oromyaa .
5 . The Amaaraa party that has been established by Wayannee was siding with its people to a certain extent .
The OPDFO also did participate to a certain degree in wakening the power of Wayannee .
The positive contributions that ANDM made can be attributed to the positive deeds OPDO made towards the Oromo movement .
This does not mean OPDO did what it is able to do .
If the leadership slips backwards , the lower cabinet might harm the people .
The protest that erupted in the Amaara region is functioning as support pillar for the Oromo movement .
This is so , because the Oromo question is a demand for the ownership of its own territory . The Amaaraa movement will be grateful to the Oromo one .
In addition , revolting at all places will weaken the system .
We do not say gun is not necessary for our people .
is needed .
It is not only gun that is needed .
You need organization and strategy as well .
This is not only to over throw the regime .
This is not only to over throw the Wayannee regime but also have the opportunity and adequately arm the Oromo people for the protection of its territory and economy .
Generally , it is important to observe what our neighbor is doing .
Jealousy might also be ok if it helps you to be more active in your endeavors .
it is not good to see our surroundings in the Diaspora and belittle the gallant deeds , determination and victory our people are scoring at home .
Our people could carry out a nonviolent resistance , which many thought would never be able to be implemented but we demonstrated it to our neighbors .
the armed struggle will also be similarly carried out when the time is ripe , and strategy and plans are in place .
Those who want to carryout armed resistance but are unable to do so should not belittle themselves by comparing oneself to our neighbors , but instead contribute towards the efforts to organize the people to be able arm themselves when the time is ripe .
We shouldn't undermine the victory the Oromo people recorded in the past eight months .
By : Jawar Mohammed - some people are witnessing that our neighbors are undermining the struggle and the victory the Oromo people have been recording for the last eight months .
Thus , it is important to remind one another on two points .
1 . Why the Oromo say that they don't kill the enemy....is it because they didn't preach it ?
Do you forget that even the government believes many soldiers died ?
If you want to know the truth it is necessary to study the history made in Chillimo forest , Mogor river , Shalla and Mul'ata mountain .
In West Showa around Gaalessa , do you know that the youth has been protecting himself from the special force of the EPRDF ( commando ) for more than two months by the gun they took from the enemy and running out of the bullets ?
Is it easy to forget the Oromo lady who hit member of the Agazi force by a coffee grinder and took his gun away ?
The reason our people don't go out with the gun , kill and dance is not because they don't have guns as much as others think .
They have some which are small in number and not modern .
As you can see it in practice , the people affirmed that that it can take away in hundreds from the government militias when they need to get it .
War by gun wasn't the strategy of the administration at various levels .
In a struggle , killing can give a passing satisfaction . If there is no strategy and preparation that can ensure continuity , it gives less benefits and more danger .
It is on purpose that our people prepared on the strategy and war . If they had gone with the gun , let alone struggling for 8 months in a large scale , they wouldn't have made it for three months .
It wouldn't have achieved these victories too .
Thus don't forget that we have been reminding everyone not to use modern guns and traditional weapons .
If you don't want to pierce don't take out your weapon , this is an Oromo proverb .
2 . What happened in Gondar is similar with what happened in Shashamane .
The forces sent by the Tigres are killed by the militias of the regional government .
If you remember , in Ajje ( around Shashamene ) the police officers and militias of Oromiya killed the federal forces .
3 . To make a successful struggle , it is necessary to balance the intensity and sustainability .
If the struggle focuses only on one of these two , if it focuses on the intensity only and doesn't breakdown the system quickly then it loses power and disperse .
We learnt this from our experiences we went through at different levels and fought for eight months with settled spirits .
4 . The struggle in Oromiya broke the fear of and motivated the other regions .
It continued for eight months without interruption due to the measures taken by the government and this gave the motivation for the other regions .
It is observable that it is learnt from Oromiya including the simple strategies .
5 . The Amhara Party which was undermined by the EPRDF , this time it is clear that it prioritized the agenda of the people .
The OPDOs too , even if it is not to the extent required , did many things in supporting the struggle and in loosening the workings of the system .
Don't suspect that some of what OPDO did in Oromiya is exemplary for the measures taken by ANDM .
This doesn't mean that the OPDO did everything it can .
When the situation escalated the administration realized and the lower level cabinet is hurting the people .
6 . The starting of the struggle in Amhara Region is a good opportunity for the struggle in Oromiya .
This is so because as the source of the struggle is a question of identity and independence it has a positive impact on the Oromiya struggle .
In addition , starting the struggle in various places helps to weaken the system quickly .
7 . I don't mean gun is not necessary for our people .
It is necessary .
But tt is not only the gun which is important ,
Tactic and strategy of war is important .
This is not only to take down this government .
Why we need this is not only to take down the EPRDF the direction we want it to go , but to have the political and economic rights of the Oromo respected ; it is important to build a strong military force .
Generally , carefully observing what the neighbor is doing is important to learn something from it .
Envy is not bad if it motivates one for a better work .
But it is demeaning to see others and hold low motivation and weaken the courage , determination and victory of ones people .
Our population has practically shown that nonviolent resistance is possible in the country though it has been said that it is impossible ; and it also taught the neighbor .
Though it is said that nonviolent resistance is impossible today , it could be successful without doubt when there is a strategy and preparation .
For those who want to hit the enemy with violent resistance , it is better to focus on preparing the tactic and strategy for nonviolent resistance instead of undermining the value of the people on nonviolence resistance .
Ashalamoo abyss and Ashuutee !?
Bishooftuu , Ashalamoo 2nd ??
In Arsii region of Oromiyaa , people curse especially children sometimes by saying let the Ashalamoo abyss that swallowed my kids also galp you down .
Or they also curse like let you be dumped into Ashuutee abyss and die .
What is Ashalamoo abyss ?
Ashalamoo is a name of an abyss .
Ashuute means a very deep hole .
Both are very deep abyss .
Of the two Ashalamoo is renowned .
Ashalamoo is located very close to Hora Langaann in Arsii Nagallee .
Oromo people used to fight with Amara during Haile Selassie time .
The Arsii people never surrendered to Hail Selassie until he was able to expand his territory .
They fought and wiped out the Amara .
Following the Oromo tradition , the Arsii had a hiding place for people who could not go to war . These are kids , children , and the elderly .
Ashalamo abyss was one of the places for concealing people .
In 1936 when Haile Selassie fled from the Italian colonizers and wen to England , Amara were moved from the Oromo land to Finfinnee .
The Oromo people used to ambush these soldiers while they were on their way to Finfinnee .
The Amara started to travel through a different route to avoid the attack , and while doing so came to the place where vulnerable people were hidden .
Many of those hidden were children .
Their number was in hundreds .
A well-known man by the name of Gooftaa Bulloo had 40 children he hid at that place .
The Amara came across these children and killed them all .
The blood of slaughtered children turned Horri/Harri Laanganoo into deep red color .
People say that remains of human bones are still scattered around at this site .
This event remains as a vivid memory in the minds of many Oromo .
The other abyss where Aayyaa children were killed is found around a place called Leephis on top of Arsii Nagallee .
Listen to what I am going to say about this very carefully , because I am not going to repeat it .
Ashlamoo the second is the place where the Tigre slaughtered us .
Bishooftuu !!
Issues that occurred during the 20[th ] century took a different form and came out in the 21[st ] century in that Oromo sites where people used to live in peace , with love , due respect now became a cemetery that is smeared with blood of the innocent .
They threw us into abyss and finished us all .
They sprayed gas from the sky onto peaceful people on the ground .
From the ground they mowed us down with live bullets .
They covered the dead bodies with dirt so that they would not be recovered .
They forbid people from mourning for their dead loved ones .
They forbid relatives to mourn for their loved ones and take them to burial places .
Let me stop here and not talk so much .
Before Asahlamoo the 3[rd ] happens to us again , we need to send the enemy to the Ashalamoo pit .
Ashalemo valley , and Ashute !?
Bishoftu , Ashalemo 2[nd ]??
In Oromiya around Arsi , when they curse a person especially when they curse children , they say `'Let Ashalemo valley that ate the sons of Ayya eat you .''
Or they say , " Let you enter the Ashute valley .''
What is Ashalemo valley ?
Ashalemo is the name of a valley .
Ashute means deep .
Both of them are deep valleys .
One of the two , Ashalemo valley has history .
Ashalemo is located around Arsi Negelle in front of Langano lake .
During the Haile Sellassie regime , Arsi Oromo used to fight with Amhara .
No matter how much Haile Sellassie was able to put the government structure in place , the Arsi Oromo people didn't surrender themselves to it .
They have been in war with the Amhara to the end .
According to Oromo culture , during war time , Arsi has a place where they hide those who are weak , infants , children and old people .
Among the places where they used to hide Ashalemo valley was the one .
In 1936 , when Haile Sellassie escaped from the Italians and enter England , the Amhara ( Haile Sellassie soldiers ) were called to Finfine from Oromo country .
Arsi Oromo has been waiting for them on the road and fought with them .
By chance , the Amharas went the other way and arrived at the the place where the Oromos hid their children , old people and the weak .
The number of children was too many .
The number of the people was in hundreds .
Gofta Bullo , who was a well-known person at that time , alone hidden 40 children at that place .
The Amharas who arrived there killed all the children .
Lake Langano got soaked with blood and changed its color to red .
It is told that the bone of their bodies is traceable until now .
Thus , it didn't disappear from the memory of the Oromos until now .
The other valley where the sons of Ayya died is at the tip head of Arsi Negelle around the place called Lephis .
I don't talk about this without becoming sure .
Ashalemo second became a valley where the Tigres killed us yesterday .
Bishoftu !!
In the 21[st ] century , what happened in the 20th changed its form and the field where Oromo preach peace , love and respect became the valley of our burial place and got soaked with blood yesterday .
They threw us to the valley and killed us .
From above , they pour chemicals on the civilians .
From below , they fired live ammunition at us .
They put it in the soil , not to make us search for the corpus .
They prevented the families who lost a member from mourning .
They prevented their relatives from mourning and paying tribute to their dead relatives .
To make it short .
Before Ashalamo ( 3[rd ]) came to us , we need to dig it and bury our enemy at Ashute !!

Liberation for Oromo People ! !
A Short Message passed from the Leader of Keerro Oromo Liberation , August , 30/2016
People have chased away OPDO and its military force from the towns and villages of western Arsii zone and started governing themselves .
#untranslated
Through the protest they made over a couple of days , people in Arsii zone were able to almost completely take over the leadership and govern themselves after they chased away the Wayanee stogie OPDO .
Many OPDO officials who joined the mass movement vowed not to work for the enemy and not to expose the people either .
the whereabouts of those who fled is unknown .
All OPDO offices in Kofalee , Shaashamannee , Kokkossaa , Qoree , Ajjee and Siraaroo have been turne to ashes .
Right now , OPDO became just like a mouse with no hiding hole .
Agaazii military did not dare to go to Ajjee , Siraaroo and Shaallaa .
Roads leading to Dodolaa and Adaabbaa have been closed to the enemy .
everybody is disgusted by the killing that happened in these areas ( Asaasa , Kofale , Adaabbaa and others ).
People burned down the Adaamii TUlluu cattle breeding station of the regime and drove away the animals as a booty .
Residents of Waabe and Eddoo burned down farms operated in Seeroftaa and GOfoore by Djibouti and Araba investors and whose harvest would have been exported to Arab countries .
Action has also been taken against buildings in the compound of the Seeroftaa farm .
People also tried to burn down farms and farm buildings found in Ardaa Etaa , Heeraroo , Xameelaa and Garaadelaas .
Around the town of Bulbulaa ( between Shaashamannee and Baatuu ), people burned 5 vehicles that belonged to Al Amuddii .
All roada leading to that place have been blocked ( by using stones , tree logs and branes , fire ) and hindered the regime soldiers from passing .
Agazii soldiers were busy moving the stones and trees that the people placed all along the roads ( from Shaashamannee up to Roobee , Dodolaa up to Boqqojjii ).
The strategies used by residents of these towns are : After Agazii has cleaned the roads and went away , to repeat the placement of blocking items and thus make Agazii clean it again .
This action has worn down Agazii .
Determination can help people to achieve their set goals .
It is reported that neighboring ethnic groups of western Arsii ( the people of Sidaamaa and Alaabaa ) are preparing themselves to collaborate with the Oromo people .
These ethnic groups have rendered various kinds of services already .
This type of mutual understanding must be encouraged so as bring Wayanne down to its knees .
The victories sored in eastern Arsii as well as in other Oromiyaa zones show that through strong resistance against the dictatorial regime it is possible to realize liberation .
To achieve complete victory , it is very important to practice the examples set in areas such as western Shawana , Gujii , western Harargee , wesern Wollagga and western Arsii .
We should always remember that it is our responsibility to clean our homes .
In West Arsi Zone , from all the towns and rural areas , the OPDO and military force are being chased away and the areas are under the control of the people .
#untranslated
After days of fighting , the people of West Arsi Zone has taken away the area from EPRDF and OPDO and controlled most of it .
Many OPDO officials joined the people ; they promised , hereafter , that they are not going to serve the enemy and abandon the people .
The whereabouts of those who run away is not known .
The offices of OPDO in Kofale district , Shashemene , Kokkosa , Kore , Ajje and Siraro are all burned to charcoalin the urban and rural .
At this time , the OPDO in West Arsi Zone has become like a rat that has no pit to run into .
The Agazi and federal forces didn't have the heart to go to Ajje , Siraro and Shalla .
On the roads of Dodola and Adaba , there was no enemy to be seen except the local communities .
The communities of this areas faced killing and torture at various times ( Assesa , Kofale , Adaba and others ) but they made sure that this does not stop them from the cause .
In this same Zone , in Adami Tulu and Gobe , the communities destroyed two big cattle farming of the EPRDF by fire and they made it out of use and the community took the cattle with themselves .
The community burned harvest stored at Oyda which was harvested from the Djibouti farm production center , Aratoni Serofta and Gofere and they were about to export it to Djibouti and Arab countries by refusing local use .
The dwellers also said that actions have been taken on the farming compound of Serofta and Gofore .
It is revealed that the community is making great effort to burn the production and compound of farming called Eta , Heraro , Tamela and Geradelas .
Around the town of Bulbula ( between Shashamenne and Batu ) 5 Al Amoudin's cars are burnt with their oil .
All the roads to the zone are closed by stone , wood and fire in all places by the community and this has highly affected the movement of the government military force .
The community put stone and wood in the road in large quantities ( from Shashemenne to Robe , Dodola to Bokoji ) and made the work of Agazi force collecting the stones and cleaning the roads .
The special method that the people of these zones are using is : they waited until the Agazi force finish cleaning the road and then they came out from the place where they were hiding and they blocked the road again .
By this method , it was possible to abort the movement of Agazi force totally .
We are witnessing that there is nothing that can stop the people who says enough to slavery and stand up to the cause .
It was heard that the neighboring nationalities of West Arsi Zone ( Sidama and Alaba population ) were getting prepared to assist the people of Arsi .
Until now , it is also heard that they have been giving assistance of various kinds .
Such understanding amongst each other should be encouraged to take down the EPRDF .
What happened in West Arsi Zone and other Oromiya Zones is a deed of bravery to stop the autocratic government and to liberate ones region ,
To take down EPRDF and to gain the liberation that is almost at hand , what is required from all Oromo is only following on the footsteps of West Showa , Guji , West Harerghe , West Wollega and West Arsi in all their respective local areas .
We shouldn't forget even for a minute that every one of us are responsible to clean up our village and vicinity .
Professor Insarmuu Qalbeessaa has passed away ! Let his soul rest in peace .

During the time when the TPLF regime was burnig Oromiya forests in the year 2000 , he was one of the few individuals who protested against and opposed the TPLF regime .
When the UN was investigating the incidence , it quoted the statements of Professor Insarmu .
As a retaliation , Waynee denied to Dr . Insarmu the status of a Professor and what goes with it for a long period of time .
We apologize to his family for not being able to get his date of birth .
We the Oromo people say may your soul rest in peace .
Listen to the full version of his story .
Prof . Insermu Kelbesa deceased!-Simarsan

Prof . Insermu has been working for more than 40 years in caring and preserving plants around Finfine , and at the end , he successfully established the Gullele Ecological Center .
In 2000 , when the TPLF burned the Oromiya Forest , he was the only Oromo professional who publicly and firstly expressed his criticism .
At that time he said that the burning of the Oromiya forest is political and later the UN used his quotes .
The EPRDF regime took this as a reason and denied him the rank of professorship for years . Prof . Insermu Kelbesa is a good man and treats his students as his children .
We do apologize for not getting his date of birth . We do express our deepest condolences .
We , the people of Oromo , say let your soul rest in peace !!

Amazing story - Abdiisaa Aagaa
Abdiisaa Aagaa was captured during the Italian invasion of 1928 and was imprisoned in Italy . He teared up his blanket and used it to scale the walls and escape from the prison after which he joined the resistance army and fought as a gallant Ethiopian soldier .
During the time when his father was serving a life sentence for losing his temper and killing his own brother , a 12-year-old Abdiisaa tried through several mans to get his father released from prison but failed , because the father was executed . At the age of 14 years , Abdiisa was conscripted into the Ethiopian military and started serving as a soldier . In retaliation for the defeat of Italy during its previous attempt to colonize Ethiopia , Mussolini prepared its military well and invaded Ethiopia for the second time and Abdiisaa , who was then 16 years was deployed to fight the Italian forces .
After receiving health treatments for the sever wound he suffered during fighting , he was kept as a prisoner in a house in the Piazza sector of the city of Finfinnee . The then governor of Ethiopia was a man named Graziani upon whom an assassination attempted was carried out . A total of 37 individuals who were suspected of instigating the murder attempt were arrested and after suffering severe torture were sent together with Abdiisa to Sicily via Somalia which was at the time an Italian colony .
Abdiisaa was a person who always used to say , why should I be defeated ?
Together with a Yugoslavian national known as Julio , Abdissa was planning how to carry out a daring escape from the highly fortified prison camp . Although he knew that he will be a stranger at any country he would escape to , yet he tore his blanket apart and used it as means by which he can smuggle himself out of the prison .
After escaping from the prison , he chose not to simply run away . Instead , he returned to the prison a few days later at night , opened fire upon the guards and managed to release all prisoners . The prisoners , who have now organized themselves as partisans unanimously elected Abdisa as their leader . The degree of loss and sufferings which the partisans inflicted upon the Italian forces was much worse than what was happening to the same enemy in Ethiopia .
As Abdiisaa was scoring heavy loses upon the enemy , they started to cajole and allure him with different means and ways to stop fighting and join their army .
The allied forces of Great Britain , France and America together with many western countries started a fight against fascist Mussolini , because Italy became an ally of Nazi Germany .
The allied forces recognized Abdiisa and started to supply him with arms and provisions . The partisans contributed to the total defeat of Italy and the big city of Rome fell into the hands of Americans and Great Britain . The partisan soldiers composed of individuals from different nationalities tied special flags of the time around their arms and marched through Rome and were overwhelmingly received by the intentional allied forces .
His was made commandant of a unit under the international allied military forces and sent to Germany to fight against the German Army . At the end of the war , the British , the American and Canadians wanted him to join their armies through various promises . However , he refused the offer saying he preferred to return to and live in his motherland
His refusal angered the allies so much that they accused him of trivial treason and jailed him . Fortunately , the sentencing was changed to financial fine and Abdisaa returned to his county . The then ruler of Ethiopia , Emperor Haile Selassie welcomed Abdiisaa and sent him to the Minister of Defense , Ras Abebe Aregai .
The minister sent Abdissa to a small Military Academy in Hoolotaa as a simple cadet . It was not until white people drew the attention of Emperor Haile Selassie by telling him about Abdiisaa that the Emperor gave him the rank of a colonel and made him his bodyguard . Thus , Abdiisa died while serving his county .
Amazing History-Abdisa Aga
After Abdisa Aga was taken hostage by the Italian invasion and taken to Italy , he torn the blanket and embroidered it and rescued himself from the Italian prison . He is the man who made an amazing history and he was the son of Oromo , soldier of the Ethiopian Empire . Abdisa was born in Oromiya West Wollega .
When he was 12 years old , Abdisa's father killed his brother ( Abdisa's uncle ) out of anger and when he was in prison , Abdisa made many attempts to rescue his father from the prison but he was not successful ; and capital punishment was decided on him and his father died as such . After 2 years , when he was 14 years old , he joined the Ethiopian Empire military and he started his military experience . After he joined the military , after 2 years , when he was 16 years old , Mosoloni the leader of Italy bragged and invaded Ethiopia to revenge his defeat and Abdisa too started taking part in the military force .
On the war as he was seriously wounded , he got medical attention and was arrested in a place currently called Piassa . At that time they captured about 37 suspected people who attempted to kill Graziani , an Italian war leader and after they faced serious torture and imprisonment ; then they took Abdisa and the other prisoners through Somalia to the Italian island called Sicily and they put them in jail there .
Abdisa is a person who usually asks himself " why I am defeated ?"
He says that to be defeated is to die . He , together with the Yugoslavia citizen whose name is Huliyo , started planning to break out of the prison , which was tightly protected . Even if he was not familiar with the country and didn't know where he could go , he torn the blanket he was given and embroidered it and escaped from the prison through the window .
Later , he didn't run away . After some days , he returned back to the prison in the night and started shooting at the police officers who are guarding the prison and rescued the prisoners who were in the prison . The rescued prison created a Group of Protesters , which is now called Liberation Group , using the ammunitions they robbed from the guards of the prison ; and they selected the brave Abdisa Aga to be their leader unanimously . The group strengthened its plan and hit many of the compounds of Italian soldiers and the Italians suffered greater crisis because of this than they did in Ethiopia .
The Italians , who faced a shocking defeat , tried to bring him to their side by promising him gifts and various things . Abdisa underlined that he is not going to be on the side of the Fascist and continued to frighten them and understand this .
At that time , the Nazi of German which kept growing when it started the second world war , the Fascist Mosoloni associated with the Germans ; Britain , France and America were in the allied and they started fighting Mosoloni .
After hearing about Abdisa , the allied started providing ammunitions and other things to weaken the power of Mosoloni . Being strengthened by that support he was attacking the Italians everywhere they stand and make cave to them . then the Italian defense force fell down and the capital city of Italy fell in the hands of America and Britain . Abdisa and his soldiers held their unique flag on their arm and entered the City of Rom city , and received a very warm welcome by the allied force .
After that , he led a larger group of soldiers and delivered his duty successfully on the last war made with Germany . After the war came to its end , the governments of Britain , America and Canada offered him various benefits to make him join their military and continue with it . Abdisa told them that he doesn't want to live outside his country and he rejected their request .
As he refused to join them and rejected their request , they took this as a slap in the face and imprisoned him . After a time , the prison time changed into fine , the payment was done and then he returned back to his country honorably . The then leader , Haile Sillassie respectfully welcomed Abdisa Aga and he sent him to the then Minister of Defense , Ras Abebe Aregay .
The Minister sent him to one of the small military camps in Holota and he appointed him as a lower military rank . But when Haile Sellassie heard about his popularity among the people , he summoned him to the palace and appointed him as coronel . He served the regime until his death .

A sever climate cycle known as El Nino is going to happen , which might affect the Horn of Africa .
El Nino occurs because of the warming up of the Pacific Ocean , and can change the climatic conditions of the world .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reports that it is El Nino that causes the climatic changes of the world .
According to researchers , the water surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean has increased by 2 Degrees Celsius because of El Nino .
Scientists affirm that it is because of El Nino that the water temperature of the Pacific Ocean has increased to a certain extent .
This is the fourth time within a period of 675 years that the water temperature of the Pacific Ocean has shown increasing tendency .
It is confirmed that the three previous temperature rises of the Pacific Ocean are due to El Nino .
Scientists predict that this year's El Nino will be significantly different from that of the past three years .
It is already estimated that this year's El Nino will not only be different from that of past occurrences , but is going to be the type never seen up to now .
The effect of El Nino is not confined to one place alone .
El Nino can widely affect or change climatic conditions of the world .
This world wide climatic effect brought about by El Nino would bring not so much change .
Many times a worldwide climatic change brought about by El Nino will last for one year .
The El Nino that occurred worldwide in 1998 brought sever damage to South America , eastern Asia and Africa .
The heavy rain caused by El Nino not only brought along devastating floods but also damaged agricultural products severely .
It is estimated that El Nino will happen this year in the month of September , the time during which farmers harvest their crops .
The problems that farmers will face as well as the extent of crop damage might not be so light .
It is very important to think about how to make necessary arrangements to minimize the damages that will happen .
El Nino does not cause damages all the time .
El Nino has a good side too .
It has become clear that arid regions that usually do not receive enough precipitation could get enough rain through El Nino .
Regions that might be benefit from the El Nino effect are around California , America and areas which are becoming arid due to lack of rain .
Even if El Nino causes floods elsewhere , it would make the arid parts of California adequately wet .
The harsh El Nino weather condition is about to happen ; it could affect the Horn of Africa too .
It is revealed that this year's El Nino weather created due to the heat from the Pacific Ocean can change the weather condition of the world .
According to the explanation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ), the factor for the change of the weather condition of the world is the creation of the weather condition called El Nino .
The researchers told that the Pacific Ocean temperature this year is increased by 2 [ 0]C and that this is a big factor for the creation of the weather condition called El Nino .
Thus it is this Pacific Ocean temperature increment that made the scientists able to confidently say that it is a good factor for creating El Nino .
This year's temperature increment of the Pacific Ocean is the 4[th ] in 65 years .
It is verified that all the past three temperature increment of the Pacific Ocean have created El Nino .
Again the scientists do not expect that this year's increment is different from the past three .
It is not only that El Nino will be created , this year , but also it is now speculated that it will be stronger and one that never happened in the history of El Nino .
The Effect of El Nino is not limited to one area .
El Nino has the power that can widely disturb or change the world's weather condition .
But this change which will be caused by the power of El Nino will not bring about a lasting change in the world's weather condition .
Most of the time the change in the world's weather condition which is caused due to El Nino lasts for not more than one year .
The condition of El Nino which was created in 1998 hit many directions of the world and had caused huge crisis in South America , Asia and East Africa .
The torrential rain which was resulted from the El Nino at that time triggered a dangerous flood and brought immense harm on the farming products .
This year's speculated time of occurrence for El Nino in the Horn of Africa is after the month of September ; it is the time of harvest for the farmers of this area .
The problem that the farming and farming products face could be stronger .
Giving attention to it and making enough preparation beforehand is a must to reduce the problem .
The El Nino weather condition is not going to bring only harm .
El Nino , has a benefit too .
It is understood that the desert areas and the areas which have been suffering from shortage of rain for a long time are going to get heavy rain due to El Nino .
The areas which are expected to get big advantage due to the condition that El Nino is going to create are California , America , which is becoming desert due to lack of rain .
Even if El Nino causes floods in other areas , it doesn't seem that it will be excessive in soaking head of California which become very dry .
Diiniyaas Alamuu Laliisaa :- Why is Ethiopia starving ?
By Diiniyaas Alamuu Laliisaa
Historical antidotes ----
Africa is claimed to be the cradle of human origin
Ethiopia is claimed to be the center of human being .
Though hunger is a common phenomenon in Africa , yet that of Ethiopia is especial .
1984 according to Ethiopian calendar .
Ethiopia's human population was 21 million .
Out of this , 7 million were affected by starvation .
This is equivalent to 1/3 of the entire population .
The number of people who were on imminent death was over 1 million or 4.8 % of the country's population .
A few of them received help from the then regime of the country .
others did not .
Regarding the hunger that occurred , many mass media and other humanitarian organizations of the world contributed the relief of the Ethiopian hunger .
One good example is Oxford .
According to the BBC report of 1984 , the starvation that occurred during that time was the first worst of its kind that affected Ethiopia .
After Derg was removed from power , a similar kind of starvation happened in 1986 in the southern regions of the country .
During this time , the Wayannee regime named the drought as " Dry Drought " or ( Green Drought ). Let us leave this as it is and go back to our main point of discussion .
I do not believe that the extent of the currently ongoing starvation has been properly estimated .
The regime even has made it public that over 4.5 million people are affected by hunger , because there is not enough rain .
Even so , UN reports indicate that the real number of people affected by hunger is more than 11 million .
Un reports says that in 2016 there were more than 15 million exposed to hunger in the eastern parts of the country alone .
This is equivalent to 19.75 % of the currently estimated 80 million human population of the country .
When the world considered the ( 1984 ) 4.8 % death rate as an amazing happening , what would they say about the current figure of 18.75 % that has increased by two folds of the previous happening .
There is doubt that this number will increase to an unmanageable degree if no immediate action is taken to mitigate the problem .
This figure has been taken from certain areas affected by famine . If it were possible to cover the entire regions affected by famine , the figure would have looked different .
What are the causes of famine ?
Some countries are not aware of famine because they do not have the necessary conditions to be informed .
The policy they follow as a country becomes a solution to this issue .
China , a country with a human population of 1.3 billion can develop its country with no major problem because it gave priority to solving hunger problem .
china whose human population makes 19 % of the world population diverted its attention in fighting starvation and gave this priority and thus could develop its economy .
If all African countries were considered as one single country and being ruled by a single leader , the entire human population of Africa would be less that of China by 0.2 billion .
With a human population of 1.3 billion , China ranks as number on in the entire world .
India with a human population of 1.2 billion is the second most populous nation of the world .
If the African continent were one single country and ruled under one leadership , then its population would be 1.1 . billion
and would outnumber USA to hold the third rank .
Africa is not able to come out of misery that is holding it back , because it is considered as and well known for being a continent of many wars and chaos .
If we look at the reason as to why there are famine in Ethiopia and other African countries , we can put them into three categories .
They are :
1 . Natural pressures that are attributed to climatic changes and droughts .
For example , if rains fall during the time when it ought not , and falls during the time it must rain , then such events will cause famine and starvation .
Also wind storms like the El Nino that affected Ethiopia would create drought , which will cause starvation .
He who has no plan will get confused .
This issue is the root cause of starvation .
When God places you in trouble He also brings forth solutions .
This happened when people affected seek a solution to come out of the problems they are facing .
If the Ethiopian people had experiences of Kenya and good intentions , they could have gone into and come out of Uganda , Tanzania and others and would have not died of famine .
This is not happening let alone at the continental level even not in Ethiopia . The people are already affected by the drought in a country that can be considered as a prison .
The economic policy of the country .
Starvation usually happens repeatedly in a country that is being ruled by dictators .
One cannot get rid of starvation by simply building rail roads , erecting tall buildings , reporting fabricated figures , displacing 10 , 20 poor people from their lands and giving it to the wealthy .
These can be accomplished after one has enough to eat .
The Ethiopian regime will be held accountable for the mass starvation ongoing . Even so , we have the obligation to help our people directly and that is my message .
I will be back .

Diniyas Alemu Lalisa:-Why Ethiopia starve ?
From Diniyas Alemu Lalisa *
From what history tells us , some ....
Africa is believed to be the origin of mankind .
Ethiopia is a country of origin in the continent .
Even if starvation is widespread in Africa , in Ethiopia it is different .
In 1984 G.C .
The Ethiopian population was 21 million .
Out of this , 7 million faced bad starvation .
It is 1/3 of the population of the country .
Immediately , more than 1 million people were exposed to death ; this could be ( 4.8 %) out of the general number of the population .
Some of them have gotten support from the government that has been in power .
others migrated .
related to the starvation , international media and many civil societies recorded the name Ethiopia as synonymous with famine and source of starvation .
For this , The Oxford Dictionary is a good example .
In the same year of 1984 , as BBC reported , this is the first and dangerous famine in the history of Ethiopia .
After the dawn fall of the Dergue , around 1986 , the famine moved from the North to the South and severely affected the people of the southern part of the country .
The EPRDF described the famine as " Dry Green ". Now let me leave this here and come to the main point of the discussion .
I don't think the extent of the current famine the people facing is determined well .
The government of the country reported that about 4.5 million people are exposed to starvation due to the shortage of rain happened in the eastern part of the country .
But , UN has reported that the number of people affected by the famine in the country is at least 11 million .
According to UN , only in the eastern part of the country up to 2016 , the number of the starved people is more than 15 million .
When this is compared to the total number of the population of the country , which is 80 million , the percentile of the affected people could be about 18.75 %.
During the Dergue regime ( 1984 ), the world was shocked when 4.8 % of the population starved to death ; currently , it has grown to two digits , 18.75 %, and this is even amazing .
If this is not contained immediately , it is obvious that it will increase and become dangerous .
This figure is only taken from the areas which are affected by shortage of rain , but I wonder how many people are actually starving , if the whole country is assessed ?
What are the factors for FAMINE ?
Among the countries where there is no suitable condition , there are some that the story of famine is not reported from .
The reason for that is the strategy they adopt .
In the a world , China has a total population of 1.3 billion people , the reason for the country to be able to grow its economy and avoid famine is its strategy .
China's population which makes 19 % of the world population , they have focused on growing their economy by designing their own policy , avoiding famine and halting civil war .
The number of the population of all the countries of Africa combined is less than that of China by 0.2 billion .
This means the population of China is 1.3 million and it is the most populous country in the world .
Indian is ranked as the world's second populous country with the population of 1.2 million .
The number of the population of all the countries combined amounts to 1.1 billion-U.S.A .
It can hold the third rank firstly .
From the beginning , Africa is known for its civil war and famine , its problem has no boundary .
Just similarly if we see at the famine which is occurring in Ethiopia and some of the African countries , we can mention three factors .
these are :
1 - Natural impact , the impact is related to the changing of the weather condition and rainy seasons .
For example , due to the changing of the weather condition of an area , when the rain occurs at a time when it is not expected and it doesn't when expected , famine could follow as season's farming produce would be affected .
In addition , weather conditions like the El Nino , which hit Ethiopia this year , can bring about draught and the risk that comes as a result is not simple .
2 - Lack of a good relationship with the neighboring people .
This is the big reason for the starvation of human being .
When God brings a problem up on a person , He brings the solution together with it .
This can bear fruit only when the people who face the problem find a way to the solution .
If the Ethiopian people learnt from the experience of Kenya and had a good relation with the people of Kenya , if they could enter and live in Uganda , Tanzania and the like as they desire , they wouldn't die due to starvation resulted from drought .
This is not only true in Africa , but also within Ethiopia ; it is not questionable that in the beginning the drought hit and kill them in the prison where they are .
3-Economic strategy and policy of the country .
In many instances , famine occurs in countries which have autocratic governments .
Thus , it is simply not possible to eradicate starvation by constructing railways , skyrocket buildings , issuing a false report and trying to deceive , displacing a dozen of families from their lands and give it rich people .
These are things that want to do willingly when they are able to feed themselves .
Thus , for drought induced famine , which hit Ethiopia , the one who should be responsible is the government of the country . My message is , let's stand by the side of our people in all fronts .
I will come back to it with evidence .

It has been reported that five regions affected by drought need immediate assistance .
The UN stated that 5 regions of Ethiopia have been affected so seriously that immediate assistance needs to be delivered to those areas .
The report indicates that a substantial number of livestock has been affected in southern Oromiyaa , northern Oromiyaa around Sagaan , Gamoo Gofaa and Somali region .
Estimates indicated the drought will linger on and after 6 months certain Oromiya regions and also nations of southern Ethiopia will be affected .
It is estimated that just to save the livestock from destruction , more than 27 million Dollar is required . Various nations are trying to help the affected reigns . Those 6 reigns which have been affected by the drought in the past are exposed afresh to a new wave of drought .
World relief organization says that already 9.7 million people need urgent aid and this figure could rise two folds after 6 months .
We call upon all human rights organizations to take the necessary actions immediately and find ways and means by which assistance can be made available to the affected regions .
It is reported that emergency food assistance is required for the drought that occurred in five regions .
Yesterday , the UN has declared that 5 regions need to get emergency food aid due to the drought that Ethiopia has faced .
In the report , it is said that so far many animals are dying due to the drought and the affected regions are South Oromiya , South Omo around Sagani , Gamo Gofa , and Somali region it has underlined that emergency food assistance needs to be provided .
Again , the organization pointed out that the drought is getting worse and if it continues like this , after 6 months it shall expand to Oromiya region and SNNP region .
More than 27 million dollars is needed only to reduce the death of domestic animals ; and various NGOs are doing assessments to provide the necessary support . Again , it is said that what is worrisome is that the current drought is happening before we recovered from the draught that hit 6 regions last year .
Currently , about 9.7 million people need food aid and the international aid organizations are predicting that the figure could increase after 6 months .
Human Rights organizations have made an immediate call for emergency food assistance .
Environmental protection could minimize potential climate change that might occur .
Planting tree and taking care of them is one way of maintaining a stable climate .
Million of human and animal lives are affected in many countries due to heavy rain fall .
On the other , there are regions where human and other lives are affected by extreme climatic conditions , because there is no water available .
It is obvious that human being is the major causative factor for climate change . Yet people seem not learn from past experiences and refrain themselves from contributing to the dangers that humans face .
These reveal themselves in the industries found in developed counties which contribute to the environmental pollution .
Many people lost their lives because of the heavy rain we had during the last rainy season in our country .
Especially , the flood that affected Dire Dawa last rainy season has left behind a bad memory .
This has also caused drought in some areas and as a result many people lost their lives and properties .
According to statements given by the officer in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency in Finfinnee , namely Mr . Tsaggaayee Gabramaariyaam , many trees and other green plants are being planted across Finfinnee city to mitigate climate change .
Furthermore , procedures are being planned to protect the surrounding environment and thus reduce air pollution .
Mr . Tsaggaayee says that issues regarding climate change is matter of life and death and as such seeking a sound solution should be the task of everybody .
People should be aware of climate change and give due protection to their environments and priority to the forest resources .
It is also reasonable not to utilize materials or resources that contribute to environmental pollution .
While the International Meteorological Agency is holding a conference in Finfinnee regarding climate change , many places will be affected by drought during the coming dry season .
Dry air has been created in the north , north east , central and east part of the country , which brought cold spell during the night . This is true in high lands which become covered with low lying clouds . Thus , people need to take care not to be affected by both circumstances , namely chilly air in the night and dry climatic conditions during the day .
People living in the low lands , especially in pastoralists areas may receive scanty precipitation which might help grass to grow . They must utilize this scarce resource carefully and effectively .
Similarly , Dr . Kabbadaa Ittaanaa , who works for the Ministry of Health , said that the information given by the same Agency regarding health affairs is of paramount importance .
Some kinds of diseases , for example malaria was formerly confined to the dry arid regions . However , it is now spreading to other areas such as Booraan and Guji thus adapting themselves to the changing climactic conditions .
As malaria infection is spreading particularly to areas where there are large scale farms and prisons are located , it becomes reasonable for the Ministries of Agriculture and Environmental Protection to take the necessary precautions and study the climatic conditions of such areas .
Such problems occur sometimes where they are not expected . Thus , it is important to observe the extent of the problem ahead of time .
Generally , the role played by the International Meteorological Agency is imperative to prepare oneself and combat problems climatic change might bring long .
The other destructive deeds hat a human being undertakes is the destruction of natural forests which contribute to climate changes .
It is also reasonable to follow the instructions and directives given by the International Environmental Agency pertaining to combating climate changes .

Giving due attention to the environmental protection reduces the risks that could follow due to change of weather conditions .
planting trees and caring for them is one of the methods to keep the balance of nature . The Change of weather condition is becoming a big headache to the people of the world .
In various countries the loss of life of people and millions of properties has been resulted due to heavy rain .
On the other hand , in many countries human life and many living things have faced devastating crisis due to lack of rain .
Even if most of the reasons for the change of weather condition is the interference of human beings , it doesn't seem that the world is learning from the crisis happening to refrain itself from making damages as much as possible .
This is due to the expansion of big industries which can highly pollute the surrounding climate in developed countries .
Due to the heavy rain that happened in various areas of our country last summer many properties and lives have been lost .
Especially , the flooding that hit Dire Dawa city last summer , has left last wounds in the memory of people .
Contrarily , drought has struck some places and it claimed the live of many living things .
According to the Head of Finfine Environmental Protection Authority , Obbo Tsegaye Gebremariam , as the crisis that resulted due to the change of the climate became worrisome to the country , implementing the government's green strategy and planting and caring for trees are going on massively in the city .
In addition , it is being focused on using renewable energy to make sure the environmental protection works and reduce pollution of the environment .
According to the explanation of Obbo Tsegaye , as the issue of climate is a matter of life and death , solving the factors that result into change of the weather condition is the first action .
By understanding this , the people should primarily work for environmental protection and forest conservation with a sense of belonging .
Again , they should refrain themselves from using non-renewable energy that pollute the environment .
Currently , the National Meteorology Agency has held discussions on the same issue in Finfine and , accordingly , due to the change of climate drought would strike many places .
Accordingly , in the North , North East , Middle and East of the country draught will hit and the nights will be very cold and some highland areas will be covered in thick fog ; thus , the necessary measures should be taken beforehand .
In addition , dry areas in South and South East , where pastoralists and semi-pastoralists live , they could get less regular winter rainand they should be able to use that properly .
Similar to this , According to Dr . Kebede Ittana who works for the Ministry of Health , the information that the agency is providing has a great contribution to the activities of healthcare .
Nevertheless , some diseases like malaria which were previously rampant in the desert areas like the rift valley of the country in the East , currently , due to the change of the weather condition they have migrated to the West and it has been harshly hiting Guji and Borena .
Related to this , as malaria is spreading to irrigation and vast farming areas , and to make the necessary preparations beforehand based on the information about the climate , making an integrated effort by the Ministers of Agriculture and Natural Resource and Health is very important .
To this end , as the problem sometimes occurs in places that are least expected , it is a must to expect the worst .
Generally , to protect the crisis that could follow from the change of weather condition beforehand and to make the necessary considerations , the responsibility of the National Meteorology Agency is very high .
On the other hand , focusing on reducing the impact of human factors like deforestation and environmental pollution should be the primary work .
In addition , based on the evidence given by the meteorology agency simplifying the potential risk is modernity .

Water as a bullet !
Yooseef Hambaa Tolaa Water used as bullet !
An article contained in the website http://www.worldwildlife.org/ estimates that water covers 70 % of our planet .
Even so , the freshwater we drink or use for irrigation of our farms is only 3 % of the global water mass .
The rest are frozen glaciers or water not available for human use .
That is why about 1.1 billion people of the world face acute shortage of water .
About 2.7 billion people of the world experience water scarcity for at least one month of the year .
An estimated 2.4 billion people face a problem of inadequate sanitation problem , and thus are affected by such diseases as cholera , typhoid fever and other water-borne diseases ,
Each year , approximately two million children die from diarrheal diseases .
Therefore , the problems associated with inadequate sanitation of water has a drastic effect on human health , especially that of young children .
In an article published in thewaterproject.org , Rebecca Shore writes that drought and the prevailing political situation in the country are two contributing factors to water shortage .
According to the study , only 42 % of the population has access to clean water supply , and only 11 % of that number gets clean water .
In rural areas of the country , these figures drop even lower , resulting in health problems in the villagers as well as their animals .
what is happening is well known to the entire world .
The regime has certain weaknesses that makes it not to withstand natural pressures .
Natural pressures reveal themselves in such areas that are already arid lands .
Other regions have been converted to arid regions due to weakness of the regime .
Agencies investing in the rural areas are destroying many forests .
This has contributed to loss of rain and thus to drought conditions .
The investors simply garb land from the peasant , and harvest abundant crop but have no interest to provide the people with water .
The regime must also be held accountable for failure to provide water to the community .
Th regime has ample fund for its political activities , but spends almost nothing towards the provision of food and clean water to its people .
The regime is spending huge amount of money in purchasing modern armaments with which it is killing the people , especially the Oromo .
What the world has not realized yet is that water has been converted into a bullet .
In conjunction with the demands of the Oromo people , the regime has devised a new scheme .
It has gunned down many people , harmed a lot , has maimed many more and hauled to prisons .
Now it is using the shortage of water as a weapon with which it is punishing people whom it has not imprisoned .
As TV stations and other mass media report , Ethiopian citizens are exposed to hunger and starvation .
It has shut down water pipes and thus uses it to punish people .
This problem has even affected Finfinnee city , which is the seat of such international organizations as the African Union .
Therefore our people are forced to drink stagnant water .
They and their animals are drinking unclean water from the same source .
People must travel a long distance just to get a sip of water .
International research is being conducted on ways and means of making enough and clean water available to people .
The Ethiopian regime is cutting off and denying to people even the scanty water that is barely available .
The regime has been shaken up by the protest of the Oromo people for its inalienable right of its father land . As a means of punishment , the regime has cut off water supply from Oromo people living in northern , southern , eastern , western and central Oromiyaa .
The regime took these measures due to many reasons . First , with the direct intention to expose Oromo people water borne diseases .
If our people would not anything , they must march long distances and drink stagnant water .
This is what is happening right now .
Reports reaching us from medical center in Gobbaa and Baalee confirm this .
The other intention is to reduce the survival rate of children , who might the ones continuing the struggle against the regime in the future .
The second reason is , the regime wants to confuse the moral the people and thus weaken the struggle .
The third and covert schemes is that the regime will use the case of water shortage as a showcase to request financial assistance from foreign countries and use the grant for purchasing armament instead .
The protest movement in the country has compelled the regime to run short of funds .
Thus , to have more funds the regime is running around day and night begging for money .
Solution for our people : 1 . Boil the water you are fetching from your water source . 2 . Buy medicaments and add mix them with water to kill microorganisms that might hurt you . 3 . Those who live in rural areas should clean the surroundings of your water source . 4 .
Build an enclosure around the source of water for human and thus separate it from that of from that for livestock .
The reason is that livestock could simply walk through water for human consumption and make it dirty .
Those who can afford it should have water well dug near their houses .!
If the cost I too high for an individual , you could have a common water well which everyone shares .
The water well should not be near of external toilets or cemeteries .
Do your best to help your children not succumb to drought caused illness .
This evil regime has denied not only water to our people but also many other necessities .
It is trying to weaken the Oromo people by shutting down such basis items such as ( face book , whatʼs up , viber , messenger , and other similar things )
This regime is merely carrying out a futile exercise , because it cannot control the Oromo people as usual .
t can abandon the reign of power willingly or otherwise it will be forced out of power .
The time will come when the Oromo people will make an end to the time line of its ruling .
It is the time when even " jerrycan " hates Wayannee and demonstrates against it .
Those who blame the regime by saying that Wayannee crashed water holding pots and used water as bullet .
It seems as if water pots are protesting loudly to be used for carrying stagnant water .
This shows us clearly the devilish deeds this nasty regime is committing upon our people .
The time will come son when we will quench up thirst by drinking clean water and quench our thirst for liberty and freedom .
The liberation of the Oromo people will serve as a bright star for all Ethiopian people who are now under the yoke of the Wayannee regime .
This will be a death blow to the Wayannee regime .
The struggle continues !
Victory to the Oromo People !

WATER BECAME BULLET !
Yosef Hamba Tola-WATER BECAME BULLET !
According to an article from this website http://www.worldwildlife.org/ upto 70 % of the planet on which we live in is covered by water .
Nevertheless , what we use for drinking , irrigation and various activities is only 3 %.
The rest is either in the form of snow or is unusable .
Because of this , about 1.1 billion of population of the world don't get enough water .
About 2.7 billion people face shortage of water for at least one month in a year .
Due to the lack of water sanitation , about 2.4 billion people are damaged by various diseases including cholera , typhoid and other diseases caused by contaminated water .
Every year about two 2 million children die from diarrhea in the world .
Thus , the crisis that results from lack of water sanitation on children , who are tomorrow's hope,is very alarming .
According to the writing of Rebecca Shore posted on thewaterproject.org , drought and political crisis the two reasons for the shortage of water in Ethiopia .
According to the research report on water.org , only 42 % get enough water , and out of this only 11 % get clean water .
But , it also explains that the goes down in the rural areas and that it is exposing the rural dwellers and their cattle to health conditions .
What we are observing now is what the world know and studied about it .
In this case , the weakness of the government and natural phenomenon can be observed easily .
The reason we raised about the natural phenomenon is that some part of the country is desert from the beginning .
Keeping this in mind , the government is responsible for the change of many places of the country into desert .
The Ethiopian government is inviting investors and sending them to forest covered areas and allowing them to demolish the forest .
This triggered desertification .
These investors don't want to provide water for the farmers , whom they took the land from .
Concerning the provision of clean water , the primary weakness is that of the government's .
The government has enough money to spend for political affairs , but not for the provision of crops and clean water .
It is spending much money to buy very modern weapons to kill its citizens , especially the Oromo people .
What the world cannot understand about Ethiopia is that water is used as a bullet .
During the protest the demand of the Oromo people for their rights , the government has devised and is devising new strategies .
It killed many people by bullet , and wounded many more ; it has also left people disabled .
And it has punished others by denying potable water .
Ethiopians have faced famine as the world witnessed through TV and websites .
In addition to this , to punish the people who staged peaceful demonstration the government has blocked the water pipe which provides potable water across the country .
Especially , the capital city of Oromiya , Finfine , which is of the seat of African Union , has faced this problem .
Because of this reason , the people is using unclean water for drinking .
They are drinking unclean water together with their domestic animals from the same pit
Even to get that many of them need to walk a long distance .
In the other part of the world researches as conducted to address the issue of lack of potable water that challenge the societies .
Opposite to this , the government of Ethiopia cuts the service of available potable water and uses it as a bullet and is killing our citizens .
The protest that started by the Oromo people for their independence has hurt the Ethiopian government and as a result North , South , East , West and Central Oromiya are under the punishment of potable water .
The government did this for many reasons : First , to kill the Oromo people indirectly by the water borne diseases .
Thus our people have to travel long distances to get unclean water .
This is what is happening .
The evidences coming from the health facilities in Goba town , Bale confirm this .
And the children who could strongly struggle against this government tomorrow could die from this easily .
The second one is to distress the people and weaken the ongoing struggle .
The third implicit reason is to gain financial aid from donors in the name of lack of potable water and use it to buy military weapons .
This could be confirmed by looking at the spending of the government to stop the protest .
To replace all these , it devises methods of getting donation day and night .
Tips for our people : 1 . Regarding the drinking water that you fetch , boil it very well and use it , 2 . Buy medicine from the health facilities that can kill germs and add it to the water , 3 . For rural people who fetch water from rivers , collaborate together and clean the water and the surrounding where you fetch water very well , 4 .
Separate the hole where the domestic animals drink by fence from that of where the humans drink . 5 . For the rural community whose water hole is around river/in forest , try to protect it from wild animals using a fence .
The reason is that they could contaminate the water .
6 . For those who can , dig a water hole in your yard !
Even if it is difficult individually , get organized with the neighbors and dig a water hole .
When you plan to dig a water hole , make sure it is away from cesspit and grave .
Make every possible way to make sure that your children are not affected by the water borne diseases .
This hated government has not only cut services of clean water but many more .
Services like electricity , telephone , social media ( facebook , whatsup , viber , messenger and the like ); by blocking these , it is trying to weaken the struggle of the Oromo people .
The government is doing what it can to stop the struggle , but it is impossible .
The one who refused to leave the power respectfully will enter the hole prepared for it disrespectfully .
Sooner or later the Oromo people will be one who will feed it the last meal .
The year is even a year when " water jug " hate the EPDRF and undertake peaceful demonstration .
The water container , rather than sitting at home empty , is opposing the EPRDF which used water as a bullet .
And it seems that the water container is refusing to carry unclean water from the river and taking out to the street to get its voice heard .
All these things can easily make us understand the behavior and activity that this cursed government .
The year when the Oromo people will drink clean water and the thirsty will be liberated is at hand .
The liberation of Oromo people will be like a candle even for the nations and nationalities of Ethiopia who are under the tyranny the government of EPDRF .
It will be the last tomb for the EPRDF government .
The struggle shall continue !
Victory for the vast People of Oromo !

The development that ushers in hunger
BBC and other media are reporting on the current hunger crisis that is affecting many parts of Ethiopia , especially the Walloo and eastern regions of the country . The regime of that country admits the occurrence of drought , but categorically denies that people have died from hunger . Instead , it is blaming the BBC for fabricating issues and intentionally trying to harm the good name of the country .
What will be will be .
Oh Wayane , you cannot suppress this free mass media as you would do with yours and cover up the truth . This is not the time during which you should waste your time in fighting but find means and ways by which you can save lives .
It is undeniable that the drought has been brought about by El Nino . Even so , it is very puzzling indeed that the economic development of the country , about which much has been said , has contributed to the ongoing starvation .
Though it is true that the naturally occurring drought cannot be averted , yet it would have been possible for the regime to take all necessary measures to protect its people from starvation .
Political analysts report that the so called accelerated economic development rate claimed by the regime is not true . Therefore , the regime considered the views of these experts as anti-development campaign . It is true that the regime was not prepared to deal with the drought and concurrent starvation of the people . There is no doubt whatsoever that there is real starvation in the country , which to a certain extent has been caused by the unpreparedness of the regime . This implies that had the regime taken the necessary measures , the catastrophic starvation would have not had an effect of this magnitude .
Development that brings famine
Various media including the BBC are reporting the devastating famine that Ethiopia faced , especially , in Wallo and eastern regions of the country . But , the government said that there is drought but not starvation and reported that there is no one person who die due to famine . The government also confidently debated that the report prepared by the BBC is only to defame the name .
" What comes this year and what calls you , never be absent ", according to a proverb .
You , EPRDF , it is not the time to control the free media to hide the problem the people is experiencing . What happened has already happened ; this is a time to rush to save the famine affected people and not a time to play political game and it shouldn't happen .
Even if it is not ncertainly confirmed of the draught is induced by El Nino , it has created a big question as to how the development and growth of the country could be met with famine .
The reason is that even if it is difficult to control the situation as drought is a natural phenomenon , the government could primarily pay attention to avoid famine and controlled the situation .
But what is heartbreaking is that political analysts criticize that the media is reporting that the country is developing , while the reality in the ground does not confirm this and the government perceive this criticism as anti-development propaganda . Eventually , the result is loss of life . This is what could be understood from the famine the country has faced . However , the fact that the draught is induced by a natural phenomenon does not make the government free from accountability for the happening of famine . It is difficult to say that the government has no role in it . Even if the government cannot avoid the happening of the drought , it could have avoided the famine if it had taken the right measurement beforehand .
Help the flooded Adaamaa
The landscape of Adaamaa is prone for flooding .
The city of Adaamaa has been totally flooded by the rain that fell last night for over two hours .
Therefore , 5 counties of the city have been flooded and other areas were affected as well .
The city administration is working in collaboration with residents to alleviate the problem .
The damage done to 5 counties cannot be considered as an insignificant matter , because the residents of these areas are presently suffering . Their properties have been damaged , and the economy of the city is affected .
Therefore , it is expected that government officials come to the rescue of Adaamaa people affected by the flood .
Adama is hit by flood , let's extend our assistance to them !
The topography of Adama city makes it vulnerable to flooding .
In the Adama City Administration , the crisis was resulted from the heavy rain that run for two hours yesterday evening .
This catastrophe has struck 5 kebeles of the Adama City Administration and the properties of the community are damaged by the flooding .
The Adama City Adminsitration is working with the community to recover from the crisis . According to the information available so far , it is reported that the flooding killed one child .
Five kebeles is not an easy coverage . It is not hard to estimate that many people are living in those five kebeles . The properties of these communities are damaged by this catastrophe and each family is affected ; this makes them vulnerable to socio-economic problems .
Thus , the people , government institutions and non-governmental organizations are expected to assist the inhabitants of Adama city who are affected by this catastrophe .
#untranslated
The Amara struggle in Gondar clearly shows that there is a significant difference between the Amara and our own people .
The Oromo people have been disarmed and thus are unable to defend themselves .
While the Amara political organization working with Wayannee , namely BAIDEN is supplying weapons underground to itself people , the stupid Wayanne stogie OPDO is busy disarming the Oromo people .
That is why the Tigres are able to slaughter our people in broad day light , gun them down during the night and consider their lives useless
but the true nature of what is happening is revealing itself .
Because they are armed , the Amara are able to defend themselves and save their people from danger .
The regional police have also refrained themselves from harming their own people .
On the contrary , ours are roaming through cities and villages , dragging people out of their home including pregnant and kill them or hand them over to be killed .
This is a sin of no proportion .
Even so , history is being written . They should know that nobody will ever escape from the law of justice when the appropriate time arrives .
Now is the time when they should develop new mind sets , change their actions and stand with their own people , because the Tigre led regime is on the verge of collapsing .
#untranslated
I do believe that anyone who witnessed the protest by the people of Gondar can tell the difference between our people and the Amhara people .
The Oromo people was unable to fight back as they were unarmed by the government .
While the Amhara organization , BLADEN , equipped its people secretly , our fool OPDO became the messenger of EPRDF and left the people empty handed .
Due to this , our people were killed by the enemy from Tigray in broad day light ; killed during the night and thrown into a cave ; and tricked with its life ....
Look , today the truth is exposed to light and all persons observed and understood it .
As the Amhara people , young and adults , are equipped with arms , they didn't get hurt totally by the enemy who came to finish them .
The Police officers of the region also refrained themselves from hurting their people .
But those of ours walked through the villages , arrested them from their homes and killed them and/or made them get killed including the pregnant women .
This is a historic crime .
History is being recorded ; and they also should know that they are not free from accountability .
Having considered the crime they committed , while the people stands up for their right and the government of Tigre is shaking and near its end , it is amazing that they are still in deep sleep when they can stand by the side of the people and liberate them once and for all from century long tyrannous system .
Cholera ( Cholera )
Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness .
Though the disease is known all over the world , yet the regions affected most are developing countries .
The agent that causes the disease is a microorganism .
A person infected with this disease can be dehydrated through loss of water because of diarrhea , would appear skinny and might eventually die .
This disease can be transmitted from one person to another if a healthy person drinks water or eats food that is already contaminated with the cholera bacterium .
Contaminated food and water , unclean conditions and environment can cause cholera .
As certain species of shell fish carry disease causing germs it is advisable to cook them well before eating them . After touching such fish type , wash your hands properly otherwise you may get the cholera causing germs . In developed countries , any fish product contaminated with any type of diseases such as cholera will be discarded .
The disease occurs mostly during the dry and spring seasons .
This is so , because it is during this time that people mostly use water .
As the mother's breastmilk has natural protection against certain diseases , cholera will not affect children below two years of age .
Science research shows that people with blood type O are more susceptible to contracting cholera .
Bile juice can also work against cholera contraction .
Bacteria not affected by bile justice pass on to the intestines .
They cause poisoning in the intestine and create diarrhea .
The mineral salt will also be discharged from the body .
Within a brief period the person infected will feel sick .
If the sick person does not get enough treatment , it is possible that he/she may die .
As a person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium , it is important to consume only safe water and clean food .
Water and food should not have cross contact with human feces .
This can be realized by using toilets .
Wash your hands every time you use toilets .

Cholera ( Cholera )
Cholera is a disease that causes acute diarrhea .
Even if it is known in the whole world , currently it is occurring and can occur in the underdeveloped countries .
Like other germs that cause various diseases , it cannot be seen with naked eye .
When this germ infects a person , it dehydrates the water of the human body in a short period of time through diarrhea and it makes the patient dehydrated and kill .
Cholera is transmitted from one person to another when the diarrhea which has the germ is contaminated with human food and drink and a healthy person eats that food and/or drinks that water .
Lack of personal hygiene , lack of clean food and water and lack of environmental sanitation have a great role in transmitting this disease ; especially , when a person drinks water which is contaminated with this germ .
Some fishes that have shells can carry the germ that causes the disease ; so , eating such fishes without cooking and not properly washing hands after touching such fishes can transmit cholera . In the developed countries , if cholera outbreaks , it is transmitted through fish .
Cholera outbreak occurs in winter and spring .
This is because people use water mostly during these times .
This disease doesn't affect the children below two years much ; this is because breast milk naturally has a content that prevents them from being affected by the germ .
People with blood type O have high risk of infection with cholera , according to some research findings .
Acid which is found in gastric can kill the germ of this disease .
Those germs which are not killed by this acid pass to the small intestine .
After infesting the intestine , they poison the internal parts of the intestine and watery diarrhea is caused .
Instantly , the salt and water leave the human body .
It weakens the patient in a very short period of time .
The person who is infected with cholera can die if immediate medical attention is provided .
As this germ that causes this disease come due to contaminated water and food , it is something not optional to keep the hygiene of water and food to prevent oneself from the disease .
Water and food should be kept away from human feces .
It is possible to do this when everybody visits the toilet .
Hands should be washed after toilet and before eating food .

Birhanu M Lenjiso : The war declared by Wayannee upon the Oromo people must fail !
As you all know , the Wayannee regime is determined to forcefully crash the peaceful demands the Oromo people are making regarding the land questions .
In the statement of the regime aired this evening on the mass media , TPLF officials have condemned the people's protest as " a terrorists ' movement ".
This implies that it would appropriate to consider people protesting peacefully as terrorist and take actions that befit terrorists .
The military forces and security have been given absolute power and authority to crash the peaceful demonstrations necessary .
This instruction is being implemented already for three days in southern and south-western Shawaa and cleansing Oromo farmers and their family .
This plan will also be extended to other regions .
For example , a large military contingent has been moved from Somalia to put the eastern Harargee zone under control .
It is an urgent and absolute necessity that the Oromo people must arise in unison and withstand the declared scheme of Oromo ethnic cleansing .
The open declaration of the regime clearly shows that it is alarmed and afraid
Therefor , among the action that need be taken :
1 ) Practice minimal risk type of protests such as being in grief , expose secrets , wear black clothes , considering the enemy as disgusted creatures , not to consume any food as well as other similar actions could be carried out widely and extensively in schools , hospitals , factories and offices .
2 ) It is important to exert a very painful blow to the enemy , because it is killing the Oromo just to exploit its wealth .
Hence , it is imperative not to buy anything produced by Wayannee companies and create all kinds of stumbling blocks to their industries
[ gibetube ]
so that they would not do businesses successfully as well as hinder them from transporting their goods across Oromiyaa . We must take all measures to shut down the economic sectors that TPLF owns in Oromiyaa within a brief period .
We are compiling the names and address of these companies and place them on mass media and request you to pass them on to others concerned .
3 ) Roads will also be blocked to hinder their military force to move around in Oromiyaa as it pleases .
Road leading into and out of different zone of the country should be blocked through various means .
4 ) Demonstrations being held in the Diaspora need to continue .
We need to focus on , follow up and disable the diplomatic and business affairs that Wayannee is doing in freeing countries .
( Pass on to others all measures that need to be taken ).
Pressures exerted by the mass media need to continue very strongly .
Funds need to be raised immediately to give especial assistance to those who are wounded . 5 ) Henceforth , both the Oromo people and Wayannee will face new realities .
Therefore , the leadership of the Oromo revolutionary movement must strengthen itself urgently and get ready to pay any sacrifices necessary .
For over a period of one months , our people have shown that they are not afraid of death , consolidated their unity , and unnerved the enemy .
We need to achieve more victories , and we certainly can .
Everybody must participate in the struggle available .
If we retreat hereafter , we will all be slaughtered one by ne .
Therefore , our people need to be united from inside or outside , whether you are young or adult , whether you live in a low or high land .
The truth is on our side , we stand together and we will win !
Birhanu M Lenjiso : THE WAR THAT THE EPRDF LAUNCHED IN OROMIYA SHOULD BE ABORTED !
As you are watching , the EPRDF government has decided to end the peaceful demand of the Oromo people about its own land by force .
Based the press release issued on the government media , the leaders of TPLF labelled the protest as a " terrorist act ".
This is to justify the violent crackdown to be taken on the peaceful protestors in the name of terrorism .
The government has given the authority and order to the military force to break this peaceful opposition and protest using all the necessary forces .
Following this order , starting the last two days , it has deployed military force to South Showa and South West and they are killing Oromo farmers and their children .
It is implementing the plan to take the measure in other zones .
For instance , today , enormous military force from the border of Somalia started moving and it is heading to occupy East Harerghe .
To save itself from this plan of mass killing that is openly launched on the Oromo people it is mandatory for the people of Oromo to act in unit and get organized in all places .
This open launching of war shows that the regime is irritated and annoyed and aborting its current mission can help to toppled down the regime and make them answer the demand of the people or get dispersed away .
Thus , among the measures that should be taken :
1 ) The protest should be continued through peaceful means like showing sadness , breaching secrets , wearing black clothes , showing upset , hunger strike and the like in the schools , hospitals , industries and offices .
2 ) It is necessary to hit them where they feel it because the enemy is killing Oromos for the sake of Oromiya's resources .
Therefore , identifying the EPRDF's companies and boycotting their products , their industries
[ gibetube ]
Stopping the operation of their industries and not allowing the passage of their products through Oromiya is necessary . All in all , by taking all the necessary measures on the economic activities of TPLF in Oromiya , we do need to close them within short period of time .
As the names and location of these companies are being identified , we will send you through the available network ; share with us what you know too .
3 ) Blocking roads should continue to restrict the movement of the military force in Oromiya .
Especially , the highways in your zones needs to be blocked using various ways .
4 ) The ongoing demonstration abroad to support the domestic protest should be continued well .
We would focus on following and aborting the diplomatic works and trade that EPRDF is having in foreign countries .
( We would share each other the measurements that need to be taken internally ).
The ongoing influence on various media should continue in a strengthened manner .
It is necessary to quickly raise money for various kinds of assistance for our people who are being wounded . 5 ) Hereafter , both the Oromo people and the enemy won't return back to the situation where it used to be .
Thus , the Oromo struggle should spread quickly by strengthening the force in all directions , and it needs to prepare oneself for the final action .
Our people have defeated panic , strengthened their unity and irritated the enemy for one month .
Today too it should gain more victory , it can make it .
All persons should act against the enemy everywhere they are and by all means they can .
Going back means our end .
Thus , both externally and internally , young and adult , highland and lowland , all of us need to act together and bring about victory .
We have the truth , we struggle in unity , we shall win !

A statement released by ODF/PGF . Regarding the devastation and killings that happened to Oromos at the Irreecha celebration
A statement released by Oromo Democratic Front ( ADO ) and Ginbot 7 Patriotic Front . You , the Ethiopian people , who are downtrodden and suffering between life and death from the Woyane's 25-year rule of terror .
We have been following the devastating sad news of killings committed against our people at Bishoftu with deep sorrow .
The devastation and killings that happened at Hora Arsadi caused by the fascist Woyane armed forces on millions of peaceful Oromo people who were out to celebrate Irreecha was with the knowledge of the so-called government , and this makes one wonder if leaders of this regime have brains to think like human beings .
There is no doubt that Irreecha is one of the many cultural symbols of identity that the Oromo people have preserved through their years of struggle .
It was a hitherto unheard of cruel action that peaceful people gathered to celebrate their religious festival were subjected to killings and forcefully led to fall into ditches .
Such a shocking incident has never happened in any society .
According to different media reports , so far many people have been killed by bullets from the Agazi Armed Forces .
What makes this even more shocking is the fact that the people were killed while exercising their human and natural rights in a peaceful unarmed way .
More than attesting to the fact that the Woyane hate all of the Ethiopian people , this shows that all human rights questions asked by any group will be responded to with impunity and crushed by armed forces , as is evident from their recent proclamation .
We understand that denouncing this massacre that happened and is happening against the Oromo people alone is not enough .
It is important to stress that the Woyane leadership is fully responsible for what happened .
In order to do away with this kind of devastation , it is imperative to unseat the Woyane government .
In order to uproot the Woyane , there is no question that unity is a force .
There is no option other than uniting forces for the struggle and dismantling the Woyane system .
We , the political organizations of ADO and the Arbegnoch Ginbot 7 , are undertaking coordinated activities to realize this .
We have no doubt that the massacre and the devastation that happened will strengthen us and makes us even more united to continue our struggle .
Our dear respected People : Your sacrifice has made us rise in unison , gather our energy , and made it our obligation to fight oppression by this bandit minority regime to realize freedom and democracy for our people .
For this we are determined and have risen up .
Thus all the people who have suffered from Woyane oppression , as well as forces of democracy and human rights waging their struggle both at home and abroad , should understand the war started against us by Woyane and positively respond to our call as follows .
1 . To all Ethiopian people : The Woyane Ihadeg leaders have for 25 years terrorized , killed , tortured , and forcefully made you disappear or flee your country , family , and peaceful life to seek refuge elsewhere , while these leaders have become the masters of wealth and luxury .
As if this was not enough , they are now waging a war of genocide against you .
In the last 11 months in the regions of Oromia , Amhara , Konso , and in different parts of the country , thousands of people have been killed by the Woyane army .
Tens of thousands of people are detained in special detention centers , surrounded by Woyane forces , and are under indescribable torture and worse treatment than that of the Nazis witnessed by history .
Worse still , detainees have been burned and killed while in detention .
They hide their brutal actions and the war they started against you . And your natural human rights questions asked peacefully are presented by them as if you have taken action to commit genocide against the Tigrayan people .
The death and massacre committed by the Woyane regime on October 2 , 2016 , at Hora Arsadi during the Irreecha celebration clearly demonstrates Woyane's declaration of war .
This declaration of war shows that the Woyane have become desperate as you are united and determined to resist suppression .
If we keep quiet after what happened at Hora Arsadi , it is easy to foresee similar action against all other people who rise up to resist them .
It means that nothing will hinder their rule by threatening , stifling , and making people feel hopeless .
Therefore , we call upon you to continue your struggle with determination and unity until you establish a genuine and democratic government system that you accept as yours . Until rule is established , we promise to stand by you through all necessary means .
To all Woyane forces active at home and abroad : The Ethiopian people are asking and calling on us opposition forces to unite and consolidate forces more than ever before against Woyane .
It has become our great obligation to leave aside our individual political differences and focus on satisfying our people's thirst for liberation and sovereignty .
If we do not find a solution to our current problems , it is doubtful that we can help the people we claim to liberate and continue to exist as a country .
In order for this to not happen , we have to get over our minor differences and conflicts and unite to work together and continue the struggle .
It is our historical responsibility to come together and discuss , unite our forces , and support each other by dismantling the boundary set by the Woyane as " those in the country and those in diaspora ," or " those legally registered and those who are illegal ."
We therefore have to listen to the people who are united and supporting each other in their struggle for rights , and we need to work together to establish a centralized system , and we repeat our national call to you to struggle jointly to reach these goals .

Oromo Democratic Front ( ADO)and Arbegnoch Ginbot 7 , 2016 PDF Document .
ODF/PG7 - Statements given by Oromo Democratic Front ( ODF ) and Ginbot 7Patriots concerning the massacre and killing on Irecha Oromo Holiday .
ODF/PG7 - statement given by Oromo Democratic Front ( ODF ) and Ginbot 7Patriots concerning the massacre and killing on the Irecha Oromo Holiday , the Ethiopian citizens who have been under the tyrannous government of EPRDF for 25 years , who have been between death and life via facing beating and torture !
We have been following with deep sorrow , the tragedy news broadcasted from Bishoftu regarding the massacre and killing of our people .
That massacre was perpetrated against descent Oromos who were peacefully worshiping at Arsede in millions , by the EPRDF fascists called Agazi and it was conducted by the recognition and order of government which is proud of leading a country ; this verifies that the top government officials and leaders have no brain that can think as human being .
It is no doubt that one of the many special cultural heritages that shows the identity of Oromo preserved by struggle of many years is Irecha .
It is a never heard story that people who are peacefully gathered to conduct religious worship were brutally killed andcruelly chased and filled into rift to death .
Such horrible news has never been heard in the history of any nation .
As we hear from different media , so far , many people were killed by bullets of Agazi force ; forced into rift by this force and whereabouts of hundreds is unknown till now .
What makes the action of the EPRDF and Agazi more brutal is that the people massacred and intimidated were peacefully asking for ending slavery , about their rights and human rights ( bare handed ).
This brutality , in addition to providing the disrespect of EPRDF to the whole Ethiopian peoples , it shows that it started implementing the proclamation it recently issued on all people who protest to halt all human rights questions by military force and rule under its dint .
However , we do understand that it is not enough to condemn the brutal massacre the Oromo people have faced and are facing only by press releases alone .
It is important to underline that EPRDF officials are totally responsible for all the offences that happened .
In order to end such grievance and trouble , it is obligatory to remove EPRDF from the root .
To uproot EPRDF , it is not questionable that struggling in unity is important .
Supporting each other and struggling in unity and bringing EPRDF to an end became obligation that has no any choice .
To realize this , we ODF and Ginbot 7Patriots , have started working together in unison on various movements .
We have no doubt that the massacre and grievance happened now will make us strong and intensify our unity to stand together and to strongly continue the struggle underway .
Our honorary citizens : your sacrification has made us stand in unity , stand strong and struggle against the grievance that few bandit groups are posing on the massive and larger people ; and to get freedom , justice and democracy to our people , standing strong has become obligatory option to us .
To this end , we are standing in determination .
Therefore , the people who are oppressed and suppressed by the EPRDF rule , those of you who are struggling for justice and democracy at home country and abroad , have to consider our call and being aware of the campaign opened against us by the fascist EPRDF regime ; hoping that you will give us satisfactory response , we have made the following call .
1 . To all Ethiopian people : The EPRDF officials has been threatening , killing , imprisoning , kidnapping , plundering and forcing you to flee away from your country leaving your family and property , while they holding power and wealth living luxury life for the last twenty five years .
failing to be satisfied by this , they declared war against you , and are eradicating you .
During the last 11 months , thousands of people were brutally massacred by the EPRDF force in Oromia , Amhara Konso and in various provinces of the country .
Tens of thousands are also crowded in unique prisons and besieged ; and are being treated in a far worst condition and facing crisis which is cruel than the deeds of Nazy that we know in history .
Besides , they made prisoners to be burned to death in prison .
Hiding the brutal actions they are taking and the campaign they opened against you , by diverting the question you peacefully raised for justice and human rights , are depicting it as you intended to eliminate the Tigrian people .
The massacre and killings on October 2 , 2016 on Irecha festival at lake Arsade proved that the EPRDF openly declared war .
This campaign was openly declared by understanding that you rised with determination to struggle against oppression , which reveals that the EPRDF is losing hope .
It is important to imagine that if the killing and massacre perpetrated at Arsade lake is kept quit , similar action will be taken on all people making protest .
It means there is nothing that prevents them from ruling by suppressing , threatening and making to lose hope .
Thus , until a just and democratic system of government that you accept to govern and to be governed by it will be established , we call you to continue the struggle you already started with determination and unity ; and we promise that we will stand by you in all directions .
2 . To all opposition forces of EPRDF operating at home country and broad : we , the opposition groups and strugglers of EPRDF , the Ethiopian people are asking and calling us more than any other time , to make us struggle in unity , to come to an agreement , get organized and collaborate and struggle against EPRDF together .
We have to bear the great obligation to see realization of liberty and freedom of our people more than our difference in our individual political outlook .
If we couldn't bring resolution to the sufferings and oppressions faced by our people , the existence of the people for who we are struggling to liberate from the EPRDF and the country to which we are belonging to will be questionable .
To this end , it is necessary to compromise our minor differences and struggle in unity and collaboration .
We have to avoid the boundaries that the EPRDF made between us , as " those in the country " and " those in abroad ", " those who are legally registered " and " those illegals '"; and it is historical obligation to come together , get united and be get strengthened in our power and struggle to uproot this hated government .
Therefore , we again , would like to extend our call of citizenship , to stand together in the spirit of unity , answering to the call of our people and join the struggle in unity till we build a coordinated political system to struggle in unison .
Justice and freedom to all people !!

For lack of confidence , TPLF has deployed a number of its agents disguised as ABO ( OLF ) combatants .
The disguised enemy agents have been instructed to identify pro-OLF men who are engaged in raising Oromo flags and expressing solidarity with OLF , as part of their sinister motive to herd them into prisons under the pretext of fighting terrorism .
Disguising themselves as OLF , these infiltrators are recruiting Oromo sympathizers , luring them with false promises like : " We will connect you with OLF ; you have to raise funds for the OLF ; we are recruiting candidates for ABO , and we shall organize you under ABO ," and so on .
Under these circumstances , Oromos staging peaceful protests are required as usual to struggle peacefully in defense of justice and democracy .
Even if you love and support OLF , you have to refrain from mentioning ABO by name and instead continue your struggle , demanding your rights .
Don't trust anybody besides those who have gone through the test of the fire of struggle .
Second , don't share secrets with anybody who poses as a supporter of the Oromo resistance movement however concerned he might appear to be for the cause of the Oromo people .
Following or trusting unknown new elements who have sharp tongues is tantamount to exposing those whom you know .
Third , you have to identify and report to concerned bodies all those new elements who , without knowing you , attempt to recruit you for OLF . You have to demand that action be taken against these elements .
Fourth , you have to organize yourselves clandestinely and your network of communications by performing continual assessment to update your system of information exchange .
When secrets are intercepted and discovered , the communication system has to be changed immediately and replaced by a new network .
Fifth , the network organized locally by Oromo resistance activists should focus on intelligence work exposing enemy programs , enemy plans of work , conditions of prison houses , weak points of enemy forces , identities of enemy combatants , etc .
Being aware of enemy programs beforehand prepares you for foiling enemy plans and tactics .
In particular , it is essential to extend the horizon of resistance so as not to give any respite to the enemy and also so it won't have any chance of survival . If it gets such a chance , it would expose you to worse destruction .
Sixth , your resistance organizers should not share your messages on the Internet .
If you are compelled to use the Internet , don't use your mobile , computer , or the Internet facilities in your home .
You have to keep your information and secrets on flash memory and then send your messages via public facilities .
Seventh , ABO branches in the country should remain clandestine and have to transmit plans of peaceful protests to the demonstrations in secret .
The main tasks are to keep and equip Oromos with weapons , to protect and pass to jungle hide-outs enemy-wanted combatants or new candidates , to identify and take action against enemy security agents that destabilize the Oromo children , and also to facilitate conditions for WBO to take action over economic structures belonging to the government and Tigre authorities .
That is what I have for the moment .
Victory for the Oromo people .

TPLF out of fear of losing power has dispatched spies acting as OLF throughout Oromiyaa
Because the people cannot find a solution and have picked up the OLF flag and singing its name , they want to make it seem like they are OLF members and round up those who show resistance under the label of terrorism and throw them in prison .
Many people that have been sent by the enemy spy on and register Oromoo activists by saying " we will put you in touch with OLF , we are raising funds for OLF , we are recruiting for OLF , we will bring you into OLF etc ."
In this situation , Its important that those Oromoos that are leading a peaceful resistance continue as before to continue focusing on topics of justice and democracy .
Even if you support OLF or love OLF , hold that thought inside you and refrain from mentioning the name of OLF and continue your campaign for rights .
Don't trust anyone except for those you went through trials of fire together during the struggle !!
Second , except for the people you know on the struggle and resistance , don't let your guard down or reveal any secrets near new people you don't know , no matter how dedicated they may seem .
It's important to watch out for those that are full of praise but new to us and follow up on their relationships and expose them to those that you know .
Third , after you study the new people in your area and find the ones that are spying on you in the name of OLF , report the ones that are spies to the appropriate place so actions can be taken against them .
Fourth , Those of you that have been recruited in secret by Qeerroo for this Oromoo resistance to strengthen the secrecy of your cell , change your communication methods and the way you pass messages in the network from time to time .
If exposed , it must be possible for that cell to be taken out of the network and line , taken apart and rebuilt as a different structure without any interruptions .
Fifth is to study how Qeerroo organizes resistance from place to place , the intelligence branch it has cultivated in places , how they take Oromoos to the prisons , the state of the enemy's army , the identity of the enemy spies etc .
Knowing the plans of the enemy ahead of time allows for the preparation of effective sabotage .
Especially spreading actions of resistance so that the enemy can remain distracted by it and cannot find a break to discover new methods and make it even more self-destructive .
Sixth , Qeerroo organizers do not pass your messages over the internet .
If you must pass your message through the internet , do not do it from your own cell phone , computer or your internet service .
Put it on a flash drive and leave it for each other in public places or places where people can see it and quickly get away from there
Seventh , the OLF organization that's established within the country should as much as possible remain clandestine and leave the matter of the resistance struggle ( peaceful protest ) to the Qeerroo established for that .
Its job is to amass weapons and arm Oromoos , build roads and help the youth that have been exposed and being hunted by the enemy as well as new recruits escape to the woods ; also to study the enemy spies that have exposed themselves by attacking Oromoos and make contact with WBO so that the spies can be rounded up ; In addition to study economic bodies of the government and Tigree officials understand their weakness and contact WBO so action can be taken against them .
That's all I have for now .
Victory for the Oromoo people !

It was understood that this action of the dictatorial government was expected , but it created disagreement among them and led them to change the plan and rather fire the workers from their positions . These people are : 1 . Lammeessa Dagafa from the Office of Irrigation Works , 2 . Mootii Oliiqaa from the Office of the Road Authority and Community Works , 3 . Asnake Gebre , who was transferred from the Office of Transportation to the Health Department , 4 .

Urgent Notice from Qeerroo of Bushoftu=================================Share it . It is now clear that the FXG which started in the rural area of Dirree has now spread to the city and warning is hereby given that no students should attend : 1 . Bole Elementary School , 2 . Bushoftu Secondary High School , 3 . Katta Elementary School , 4 . Model Secondary School , and 5 . Uniy Elementary School .
It is also reported that schools around Bushoftu are preparing to do the same .
A concert called " Oromiyaan Tan Oromoo ti " took place yesterday in this manner in the UAE .
I am amazed by the love the Oromo in the country have for one another .
Where are you from ?
There is no question as to where you are from ?
If he sees you have Oromo blood , he gives his blood for you .
The biography of Obbo Amiin Abba Bungul that Mohammed Ademo wrote disturbed me .
When he left his birthplace of Jimma and went to Adabba in Arsi , he knew nobody there .
Later he gained a lot of space in the hearts of the members of the local community .
Amin died in a car accident when he was on the way back from Jimma after burying his mother .
His wife is pregnant and is still in critical condition .
That makes me think of the boundless love our people have for one another .
Within a few days after Dr . Amin's death , people contributed over a million Birr for his children's assistance . I wish there to be love for one another among us in the Diaspora , too !
That would be a solution for our political problems as well !

The love the Oromoo people in the country have for each other amazes me .
There's no Where did you come from ?
or where were you born .
If Oromoo blood is seen in you then you're family .
The biography of Dr . Amiin Abbaa Bungul , written by Mohammed Ademo touched my heart
When he left the place he was born ( Jimmaa ) to go to Arsii ( Adaabbaa ) he didn't know anyone .
But later , he found high regard in the eyes and hearts of the people in that community .
Its when Dr . Amiin was coming back from visiting his mother in Jimma that the car accident took his life .
His pregnant wife is still in critical condition .
What made me think of the unconditional love our people have for each other is this .
Days after Dr . Amiin passed away the community of Adaabbaa city came together and came up with 1 million birr to raise Dr . Amiin's children with...Oh I hope the love that you have for each other touches those that are in the Diaspora as well .
If that happened we would even find a solution for our political problems .
Three people so far have been attacked by enemy bullets in the Mandii district of the West Wallagaa zone during protest demonstrations staged in connection with the Master Plan of Finfinnee City .
OMN : Residents have described the prevailing situation in Mandii town as extremely worrisome .
A strong protest was staged in Mandii town of Mana Sibuu of the West Wallaggaa zone today against the Master Plan of Finfinnee City , which was presented to all of the Oromiyaa towns by Caffee Oromiyaa .
The protests started in the compound of the preparatory school of Mana Sibuu , but later on spread to the streets of Mandii town , according to residents and students .
It is also reported that three persons have been wounded by gunshots fired at them by police and security , while others have been beaten during the demonstrations .
A resident of the town told OMN that the protests have been being held since early morning .
The students even shouted angry slogans while leaving the campus .
In a few minutes , the streets of Mandii town were filled with heavily armed security forces .
Three people were fired at during the shooting and the beatings .
A resident disclosed that the wounded are currently being treated at various hospitals .
According to him , the number of wounded persons could even be higher than what has already been disclosed .
This person added that , although the students have submitted their demands and objections to the Master Plan to the Mandii town administration , they have not been given any reply .
Afterwards , the students continued chanting their slogans .
We approached a student for his comment on this . He said that the protests began on the campus of the preparatory school in Sibuu Siree . He added that the Finfinnee Master Plan has a policy of displacing the Oromo people from their land .
He also revealed that the plan adopted by the government to integrate Oromiyaa into the federal fold is not really in the interest of development , as claimed by the so-called Integrated Plan Proclamation . He said that its aim is rather to destroy the culture , history and identity of the Oromo people .
The protests that were started by the students have now spread to the town and involve local residents .
The student explained that security forces have surrounded the entire town in a bid to disperse the protests .
Both the town resident and this student disclosed that the situation in Mandii town is extremely distressing .
The student also disclosed that the schools in the town are closed down .
At the time of our interview with the town resident , the sounds of gunshots and ambulances were heard .
It should be remembered that Obbo Dhaabaa Dabalee , head of the OPDO and representative of Oromiyaa Region with the rank of Vice President , told the local media recently that the Master Plan shall not be implemented if it is rejected by the Oromo people .
Reported by Usmaan Ukkumee .
It has been reported that three people were gun down so far while protesting the Finfine master plan on a demonstration that was staged in West Wollega zone , Mendi district .

Protest demonstration was held today in West Wollega zone , Mene Sibu district , Mendi town against the Finfine master plan proclamation that was intended to incorporate the surrounding Oromia cities .
Residents and students said that this protest was started in Mene Sibu preparatory School and later expanded to the streets of Mendi town .
Report says that three people were wounded from bullets fired by government security forces , and the rest are suffering the security beatings in this demonstration .
As one resident of the town told OMN , the protest was started by the students in the morning .
Students staged protest by voicing their demands and rushing out of the school compound .
After sometime , the streets of Mendi town were full of armed security forces .

Even though the number of people shot by bullet is three , it is expected to rise ..
As the report says , before staging the protest demonstration , students have requested Mendi town administration for a permission to make peaceful demonstration , but they were given no response .
After that , they continued voicing different slogans .
As one student we talked to said , the students first protested in Mene Sibu preparatory school and that the students voiced their demand that the Finfine master plan is aimed at evicting Oromos and must be stopped .
And he said that the government's plan to incorporate the Oromia cities surrounding the capital city under the federal government in the new proclamation for the purpose of development is just a pretext , but in reality it is intended to eliminate the culture , history and identity of the Oromo people ; thus , students said they have to stand against it .
This protest , which was started by the students , involved the people and expanded into the town .
This student said that the security forces besieged the town to stop the protest .
As a student who is a resident of the town said the prevailing situation in Mendi town is horrifying .
The student also told us that the schools are closed and the town is in lock down at this time .

It has now been about 8 months since the protest in all of Ormia started to have the peoples ' national right and right to property ownership be respected .
The Ethiopian government killed over 600 people during this 8-month long nationwide protest .
On November 12 2015 , in Gincii town , the first Oromo protest started and has been going on for 8 months nonstop .
When we talk about this 8 month long protest , we cannot forget mentioning Ginccii .
The town is still in protest ,
Not only protesting but also five lives lost .
Many more are detained .
The whereabouts of many more is still unknown
And yet people's protest is still going on .
Student Eshetu Worku was recently killed and following that the unrest in the town is still worrisome .
It is reported that from time to time the security forces detain people
We halve interviewed some residents of the town regarding the problems in the town and their experience during the eight month long protests .
According to a resident who said today is the eighth month on July 12 since the protest began .
The town has not rested during this 8 month ever since the protest began .
A lot of lives lost as people protested to have their national rights of being the owners of their own land .
The Ethiopian government soldiers have taken cruel actions against the youth , children , the elderly and pregnant women and in general against anybody who is raises questions about the Oromo rights .
In Oromia all homes are taken by sorrow .
Families send their children to school but their bodies come home at night .
Many families sent their children to school and do not know their whereabouts .
They do not know where the children went after being kidnaped by security forces from the schools .
They said that over fourteen thousand people have been put in different prisons and are being tortured .
In connection to the killing of Ashetu Warqu before yesterday , there still is a strong protest going on .
They said that detention and beating of civilians is getting even worse
According to a woman resident of the town , when all this cruel acts and killings are committed , no authority at has tried to interfere .
Meanwhile , the Oromia Police expressing their anger saying peaceful civilians should not be beaten but the Federal Police continued to harm people .
The Ginccii residents say that as a result there is a big difference between the two forces .
There were a lot of youth taken away during the last three days in Ginccii according to this eye witness .
There is no law or authority to appeal to in order to stop this killing , torture and detention against peaceful civilians .
The so called Oromia government has no plan or action against this suffering of the town .
Looking back on the 8 months of protest , the resident said that there is a shining protest all over Oromia today .
One can't tell the number of sacrifices being made .
The bloodshed of poor civilians is by the government forces is unabated , the resident said .
The united strong Oromo protest in the recent years is specially noted in the history of the country .
The resident said that the sacrifice paid by the Oromo ranging from young children to old people while fighting for Oromia in unity makes us proud .
We specially don not forget the torture , arbitrary detention , beating and rape of girls and women being perpetrated by the government forces .
The killings of unarmed peaceful women demonstrating to ask for respect of their basic human rights will not be forgotten and forgiven .
The resident notes that in history , the Oromo people have never had support from other for their struggle .
They were independently fighting their enemy alone for their survival to date .
The robbing of their wealth on their own land is not what just happened in these eight months .
It has become normal for the Oromo that for hundreds of years , they have been killed , tortured and forcefully moved from their own lands .
It is sad that the Oromo people have no sympathizers and allies for struggle despite facing all these problems .
It is now known that although Gincci was the start of the latest protest , it has gradually been an Oromia nationwide phenomenon with similar demands
The Ginccii town , during all these months has not rested from protesting .
From the beginning of November 2015 to date the town has lost five people , the resident said .
The resident has a general message for the Oromo people regarding the latest 8 months of protest .
The heavy handed action of the government against innocent civilians has intensified the protest rather than becoming a solution .
The question for national right one's own land has begun peacefully but the response by the government has been killing and detaining people thus resulting in the continued protests .
The international media has now turned its attention to Oromia because of the Ethiopian government's illegal acts against the peaceful protesters .
The European Union , the USA and the human rights organizations have said that they cannot simply be silent and watch the problems facing the Oromo people .
It is also to be noted that they warned the Ethiopian government to stop the atrocities it is committing against thee Oromo people .

OMN:News July 12,2016 the protest that took place for eight months still continued in Ginchi town .
Starting before three days till now , around 100 youth have been detained in Ginchi town as residents say .
The Oromos are paying great sacrifices for their independence .
It is now eight months since the questions of the right for independence raised all over Oromia .
Due to the Ethiopian government's action against the Oromo people during the past eight months , more than 600 people were killed .
November 12 , 2015 the first Oromo protest started in Ginchi town and still continued without interruption .
During the start of the protest , Ginchi town was the leading .
Towns are hosting protests at this time .
This town not only hosted protests , but also it lost its five children .
Many people were also detained .
The place where many of them were taken by the government is still not known .
However , protest of the people did not stop .
Because of the protest that occured there this week , student Eshetu Worku was killed by the federal police and following that the situation in the town is frightening .
It was also reported that many people are being arrested by government security forces from time to time .
We have talked to some residents of Ginchi town on its current situation and during the eight months of the protests .
Resident of Ginchi town says that the protest was started in the town on July 12 , 2016 and it is now the eighth month .
During these all months , the town never refrained from protest .
Great sacrifices have been paid on the protest in request for the right of independence
Soldiers of the Ethiopian government inhumanly took action of killing on children , , youth and pregnant women , in general on those who feel responsibility for the right of their people .
All houses in Oromia were filled with grief .
Parents send their children to school in the morning and receive their dead body in the evening .
Many parents stopped sending their children to school .
Security forces kidnap students from school and the whereabouts of many children is unknown .
They also said that more than fourteen thousand people are under harsh treatment for different reasons .
In relation with the killing of student Eshetu Worku last time in the town , protest continued still .
The beating and imprisonment of civilians continued worsening from time to time .
At the time of the brutal action against the civilians , no one came to be to their side as the people of Ginchi mentioned .
While the federal police were brutally cracking down on the people of Ginchi town , the Oromia police condemned the beating of the people .
the residents of Ginchi town told us that difference arose between them due to this .
A resident of Ginchi town we talked to told us that starting from three days before , many youth were detained in the town .
People accepted the killing , imprisonment and human rights violation and they had no one to appeal .
Those who say they are governing Oromia also gave no attention to the grievance of the people as this man told us .
A resident of Ginchi town recalling the eight months of the protest said that violent protest is underway all over Oromia .
Unimaginable sacrifice is being paid .
She said that the blood of the poor is flowing by the action of the soldiers deployed by the government .
It is the first time in history that the Oromo people stood in unity during the years before and now to protest for their right .
They said that they are proud in the sacrifices paid by the youth and the old for the sake of Oromia .
The killing , threatening , imprisonment and raping of the Oromo girls is specially unforgettable .
On the peaceful demonstration made by the Oromo girls for their right , the killing committed by the government is not something easily taken .
when the residents of Ginchi town , recall the protests made over those eight months , the Oromo people from the beginning had no supporter during the struggle .
It has come a long way struggling for themselves and paying necessary sacrifices .
It is not something that came to light that it has been robbed of its resources in its own country during the eight months of the protest .
They said being killed , threatened and sent into exile has been their tradition since hundred years ago .
At this time of hardship , it is sad that the Oromo lost a commerade in an army .
As it is known the first in this protest was Ginchi town and the protest through time expanded and involved the whole Oromia .
Throughout these all months , Ginchi town has never interrupted the protest .
This man told us that the town has lost the life of five people from the middle of November 2015 till last time .
When a resident of the town sends a message to all the Oromo people regarding the protest that lasted eight months .
It is known that the brutal action the government is taking against civilians will accelerate the protest rather than bringing any lasting resolution .
As the government responded to the peaceful demonstration requesting the right of their independence by killing and detention , the protest still continued .
Attracted by the peaceful demonstration and the brutal crackdown of the Oromo people by the government , the international media have turned their attention to Oromia .
During the last eight months , all human rights organizations including European Union and USA are stating that they should not keep quiet on the problems the Oromo people faced .
It is also recalled that they warned the Ethiopian government must stop its brutal actions against the Oromo people .

ABO headline : Protecting people from starvation has never been the policy of the Ethiopian government .
ABO headline : A whole generation has now passed since the international community realized that the Ethiopian Empire is a place where citizens are devoured by famine .
Above all , the 1974 famine that occurred in southern Ethiopia shocked the entire international community .
The famine angered the Ethiopian people , forcing them to rise in rebellion .
It incited workers and students to rise in revolt against it .
The 1974 famine caused tens of thousands of people to fall away like leaves from trees .
The world at the time witnessed infants as they were suckling the breasts of their dying mothers .
Hundreds of thousands also fled their homes .
While this was happening , the rulers , instead of making efforts to resolve the all-consuming problem facing the nation , tried hard to hide it from the eyes of the international community . In that way , they ruled the country for half a century , often flattering the people with slogans that said : " The people that we love and who love us ."
The government that came to power later , inheriting the monarchic throne of the Ethiopian Empire , although proclaiming nominal reforms , provided no solution whatsoever .
The Derg regime , in total unconcern for the respect of peoples ' rights and the right of citizens to work and make a living in peace , was thus unable to eradicate famine in the Empire .
That being the case , the people could not escape from the effects of two cycles of drought that occurred during the Derg regime .
As a result of the famine , the mass flight of citizens to neighboring countries continued as a way of escape .
Even after the downfall of the Derg , the people of Ethiopia did not have the opportunity to enjoy the right of self-administration , to be ruled by a government of their own choosing and to exercise other democratic rights .
The repressive government now in place only paid attention to the interests of the minority group representing one region , being guided by a policy of repression that , instead of resolving problems , in fact worsened the situation .
Even today , the people of Ethiopia are agonizing under severe conditions of famine and poverty .
Citizens are severely affected and material properties damaged as a result of recurring drought crises in different parts of the country .
In the last 24 years , over four million people have managed to prolong their lives because of the relief aid coming from other countries .
This has been happening even while the government was boasting of registering a two-digit growth rate , with claims that it is giving due priority to public interests and democratic governance .
Information sources confirm that as a result of the drought crises occurring in different parts of the Ethiopian empire , children are victimized , citizens are fleeing their homes and livestock are perishing .
However , the Wayyaanee government , instead of giving sufficient attention to the problem , is undermining the crises by behaving as if nothing bad is happening .
And this has been the long-standing tradition of the rulers of Ethiopian .
Ethiopian rulers have always tried to keep famine crises hidden from the people of the world .
Chanting slogans that it shall feed its people three times a day , this government has in fact exposed millions of citizens to starvation and displacement ; it cannot escape being held accountable for trying to hide this grave matter with the intent of salvaging its public image .
Giving priority to one's own image and power at the expense of citizens ' lives is a great crime .
The reasons for the recurrence of famine in the Ethiopian empire are well known .
The primary reason is the lack of a government that is intent on promoting the interests of the people .
Famine and the Ethiopian people have co-existed for a long time , mainly because the Ethiopian regimes , far from working to eradicate famine crises , only paid attention to the interests of their own officials to ensure their stay in power . They believed that hungry people were unable to withstand them , and that in this way they could stay in power .
Famine and other problems can be eradicated from the Ethiopian Empire only when the people are able to gain freedom and liberty .
To eradicate famine , it is imperative to do away with regimes that give greater attention to bribery and corruption .
That being the case , providing a practical solution must involve not only feeding the famine-stricken people , but also liberating the people from oppression and slavery , by which the recurrence of drought can be reduced .
Theme OLF : It has never been the desire of the Ethiopian government to save its citizens from disaster
Theme OLF : It has been more than one generation since the world recognized that Ethiopia is a place where people die from starvation .
Specially the drought of 1974 shocked all the world's community .
It caused the anger of Ethiopian people against the imperial regime .
It also caused the students ' and the workers ' strike .
By the drought of 1974 , tens of thousands of people died .
The world saw a child dying while getting breast fed .
Thousands were forced to leave their hometown .
While this was happening , the government that ruled the country for more than half a century saying " the people that love us and that we love " didn't attempt to resolve the peoples ' problem , it even attempted to hide the problem from the world's community .
The government that ascended to the imperial throne to rule the country blaming its predecessors for the death of the people by hunger , used to legitimize its power that was obtained by force , but no change has come .
As the Dergue regime also had nothing to do with the protection of the rights of nations and nationalities , it couldn't eradicate hunger from the country .
For that reason , people could not escape from the two rounds of hunger happened during the Dergue regime .
Due to hunger , many people exiled to the neighboring countries .
After the downfall of the Dergue regime , people could not get the opportunity of self-determination , to be governed by the government of their choice and enjoy their democratic rights .
As the ethno-nationalist government giving priority to its own ethnic group came to power with its ambition to robe and oppress people , the dictatorial regime continued and the problem of people even worsened .
Today also , the Ethiopian people live under starvation and poverty .
By the recurrent drought , people and their properties have been suffering .
During the last 24 years , more than four million people were rescued by foreign aids .
This has been happening in the past and today in the country claiming that the registered double digit economic growth gives priority for democracy and interest of the people .
Many sources indicate that due to the current drought in different places of the country , children and animals are dying , and people are exiling . .
However , the government of Woyane denies the existence of hunger ignoring the effect of drought than giving a special attention for it .
This is the tradition of the Ethiopian rulers for long .
The Ethiopian rulers attempted to hide the hunger that is clearly observed by the world community .
The government which has been announcing to ensure food security , , seems trying to hide the fact of millions ' starvation and exile to the neighboring countries , to keep its reputation .
It is a serious crime to prioritizeone's own reputation and power than the life of people .
The reason why recurrent hunger happens in Ethiopia is clear .
The first reason is the absence of concerned government
Ethiopian rulers give priority only for those on political power , and as the starved people cannot stand against the government , they think that it is convenient for them to prolong their rule ; they do not want to eradicate hunger for they also use it as a source of income and that is why hunger persists in Ethiopia
Hunger will be eradicated from Ethiopia only when people get freedom .
To get rid of hunger , the government that gives priority for corruption and terrorism than the interest of the people must be removed .
Therefore , the problem of the Ethiopian empire cannot be solved only by helping the people suffering from starvation , but it requires liberating the Ethiopian people from oppression and suppression and bringing lasting solution to avoid the recurrent drought and hunger .
The torrential rains that flooded Oromiyaa have rendered over 300 thousand people vulnerable to dependence on emergency relief aid .

The United Nations plans to collect the money needed to support the needy in Ethiopia .
#untranslated
In Ethiopia about 10.2 million people are waiting for assistance due to the problem of climate change caused by El Niño .
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance ( OCHA ) reported last December that about 1 billion , 400 million dollars is required to support these needy people for one year . This is about 25 billion Birr in Ethiopian currency .
However , according to today's OCHAN report , they didn't get a sufficient response for the money that they requested . For this reason , the OCHAN planned a fundraiser in 90 days to support those Ethiopians affected by the changes in weather conditions .
Mr . Ahuna Onuchy , the Head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance , Ethiopia branch , says that the summer weather has become a serious challenge and that they require more aid .
Jermi Konindaik , Director of the USAID Office , said after his recent visit that the disaster is worse this year ( 2016 ) than the one in 1977 .
" This drought is the worst drought in 50 years . We have not seen this since we were born . It is worse than the drought in 1983/84 ," said the people when we visited Tigray .
" This disaster is not expected to be like that of 1983/84 , because we knew about it early on , and prepared for it . Aid has been requested from USA and other organizations since last winter ."
Among the 10 million , 200 thousand Ethiopian people who are estimated to be in need of assistance , about 8 million of them have already been received assistance under the safety net programs .
In the coming three months , the United Nations Organization is going to raise a large amount of funding for those people in need in Ethiopia .
Out of the $1 billion , 400 million reported needed in December , only 700 million dollars were raised .
The United Nation's aid organization set a goal to fund raise the money to help the poor in Ethiopia within three months .

As a result of the change in climate caused by El Niño 10.2 people in Ethiopia will need assistance .
The United Nations office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , OCHA reported this past December that helping several million people in one rainy season will require $1.4 billion . If this is converted to Ethiopian currency , it would be 25 billion .
Nevertheless , according to the report OCHA released today , it did not receive the amount of money it requested . So , OCHA plans to raise the remaining funds to help Ethiopians who have been affected by the change in climate within the next months , or 90 days .
According to the head of the Ethiopian branch of OCHA Ahunaa Onuchii , Ethiopia's summer conditions worsened and caused the need for such large amounts of aid .
According to Jeremy Konydnyk , the director of the office of Foreign Disaster Assistance who recently traveled to Ethiopia , this summer ( 2016 ) is worse than the 1977 famine .
This summer is the worst summer . People have not seen such a summer in 50 rainy seasons . Even when we went to Tigray to visit the natives we did not see such a summer , not even since we were born have we seen this . They said it's worse than the famine of 1983 and 1984 .
We don't expect the extent of this crisis to be as bad as 1983 and 84 . This is because we knew ahead of time where it would strike this summer and it didn't affect us . The United States and various organizations this past winter have been saying that this problem will come and asking for help .
Out of the 10.2 million Ethiopian people that are said to need aid , about 8 million that are in danger are being helped by a program called safety net .
This United Nations aid organization is on its way to raise a large sum of money in the next three months to help the people suffering in Ethiopia .
It only received $700 million of the $1.4 billion it requested .

Awaday , Oromia WASHINGTON , DC ( VOA Afaan Oromoo ) -- Mobile phone and mattress shops in Awaday town of East Hararghe zone both caught fire , and the efforts of residents to put out the blaze proved fruitless . Instead of positively responding to calls for help by the public , officials of DH.D.U.O who were nearby at the time remained indifferent and unhelpful . They in fact replied with mocking laughter . When residents shouted at them , saying , " We know that you don't represent us after all ," the officials called in armed forces by mobile phone .
The first to arrive were Oromia police , followed by the federal police . Residents said the chairman of 02 Arada kebele , Obboo Abdii Idris , opened fire , killing three persons including a 7-year-old girl .
A member of the National Defense Force by the name of Mohamed Abbaa Qaasim also killed three persons in the area of Malkaa Bal'oo . Residents coming together from the town and the countryside called for the arrest of the offender , but he was smuggled out by army vehicles .
Concerning this matter , we made all efforts to get access to the heads of the town administration as well as the police and other bodies at various levels , but all in vain .
However , sources in Haramaya Hospital revealed that four children were shot dead and three others are receiving treatment for injuries they sustained . Residents said casualty figures may be far higher as not all victims have been taken to the hospital .
Residents say six people were killed as a result of a conflict that took place in Awwadaay city in eastern Harargee .
The hospital has confirmed the death of four people

Awwadaay , Oromiyaa WASHINGTON , DC ( VOA Afaan Oromoo ) -- The attempts of city residents to put out fires that were started in a mobile phone and mattress store today in Awwadaay city in eastern Harargee has failed . The residents stated , After that when we asked the DH.D.U.O authorities that were standing around for help , they did not provide any except for laughing at us to which we responded by saying that " they never represented us anyway " and they called the forces on us .
The residents stated that the first to arrive was Oromiyaa police , then the federal police arrived before the army . Within that time the head of county 02 Mr . Abdii Idriis shot and killed 3 people including a 7 year old girl .
Residents said Mohammed Abbaa Qaasim a member of the army forces and a native of the Malkaa Bal'oo area also killded 3 people . After that the city and country residents all came and demanded that the person who killed our people be killed and he was snuck out of the area in a military vehicle .
The attempts we made to speak to the administrative authorities and the head of the office of the police regarding the killings in the city of Awadaay on their cell phone did not succeed .
But the statement that Haramaayaa gave us confirmed that 4 young people were shot to death and another 3 were wounded and receiving care . The residents state that the they have no doubt that the number of people who were shot and killed is higher and that not everyone was taken to the hospital .
The Oromo people continue to be subjected to untold suffering as the Wayyaanee government continues to neglect the drought crisis prevailing in East Harargee and East Shaggar .
August 26 , 2015 , Finfinnee . A shortage of rain in East Harargee zone has become a source of alarm and worry for the people .
Ever since last June , the people have been repeatedly reminding the Wayyaanee government that the failure of the rains has destroyed all of their livestock , but in vain .
What the people feared has come true as the Wayyanee government has so far provided no solution .
Currently drought has become widespread , affecting the whole country because of the failure of the rains .
Following the destruction of livestock in the Harargee region , the people have been overwhelmed by fear and anxiety .
A shortage of rains has been observed throughout the country , but East Harargee and East Shaggar are the worst affected .
Great numbers of livestock have perished in East Shaggar .
A great famine crisis is stalking the nation at present .
As the current crisis looms large , the Wayyaanee government is busy devising ways and means of oppressing the Oromo people even more and confiscating their property in efforts to make Oromiyaa their own .
This is indeed alarming .
People all over the country continue to express fears that , unless the rains come soon , the people will reach a stage where they could eat each other .
As mentioned earlier , even children have long since begun dying for lack of food .
Livestock have nothing to feed on .
During the final days of May and the beginning of June , rain had fallen two or three times and the people had started sowing seeds .
But as the rains suddenly stopped , all of the crops withered away .
All of this happened because of the failure of the government to implement disaster prevention through , for instance , reforestation . A responsible government should have prepared for eventualities like this , instead of exposing the people to crises of this nature .
What is most disturbing is that , as if the problems of lack of rain and famine had not sufficed , the Wayyannee government is demanding and pressurizing the people to immediately pay for the cost of fertilizers and select seeds .
Such undue demands are observed all over , especially in the regions of Fantallee , Adami Tullu , Dugda Boru , Bossetti and Adama .
The Wayyannees are demanding that the cost of fertilizers and select seeds be paid on time . The Wayyannees don't seem to be sorry for the failure of the crops grown by farmers .
Although the failure of the rains and the resultant droughts are most severe in the East Shaggar region of Oromiya , the crisis is also manifest in parts of the Amhara region , as the Gojjam natives have begun fleeing from their homes to the Sudan and Eritrea . There are alarming reports everywhere that , in the absence of a swift solution , people may be forced to eat one another eventually .
Meanwhile , the Wayyaane government is widely engaged in land grabbing and desertification , with support that it finds from overseas investors .
This situation has raised questions among students , workers and other groups in Oromiya . But the enemy remains as unconcerned as ever .
It is encouraging that the Oromos , even in the midst of this crisis , are bravely confronting the enemy .
We keep on seeking aid by standing alongside our people .
Those who are licking the boots of the Wayanees to be given Oromo-displaced land will surely pay for it , sooner or later .
The houses that they build on Oromo-vacated land will surely collapse in due course , because it was stolen .
The wealth that they accumulate in this way is accursed , and will remain nagging at their conscience forever .

The day has just dawned .
The time being the month of Ramadan , the resistance movement seems to be rather slow and cool .
Nevertheless , " Karibu Kastama ...!"
Whether you understand the meaning or not , you hear this saying wherever you go .
Try to assess the situation by looking into the eyes of the traders who are lined up along the pavements with their goods .
This is Nairobi , a major city of East Africa .
This is a center of politics , a center of business , a recreational center , and a center of terrorism . We may call it whatever we please .
This is true .
It has various features and modes of behavior .
It accommodates great and small things . It embraces pockets of activity left and right...this is Nairobi !
If you are a stranger in this place like me , try to do some research first .
At first you think , " This is a peaceful place !"
And then somebody walks up and says to you , " Late kitabuliso ...!"
If so , then the person is a security guard or
Guess what , he could be a cop .
In that case , he will question you and try to find out something about you . He will ask you to give him your ID card . You must stay calm and try to answer him . Agents of the Wayyaanee , perhaps , Nairobi , August , 2015 .
Qerroo reported that as a result of the Wayyaanee government's inability to give attention to the drought in eastern Harargee and Eastern Shaggar zone the people have suffered greatly .
August 26,2016 Finfinnee , In eastern Harargee the drought has placed the people in a troublesome and dangerous condition .
For the past months starting in June , the people have been voicing their concerns to the Wayyaanee government about a possible coming drought by saying " if there is no rain , we will not be able to feed our cattle and the current conditions indicate that there will be no rain ."
What they said happened and the government has not responded with any solution for this .
At this time as a result of lack of rain the drought continues in many places .
In the Harargee area the loss of cattle has caused the people worrisome conditions and famine .
As a country , the lack of rain has affected many places but there is solid evidence that the Harargee and eastern Shaggar regions are experiencing higher levels of exposure to drought .
In eastern Shaggar many cattle are dying of hunger .
Famine has also stricken the people .
While this problem is taking place , the Wayyaanee government is thinking of how to hurt Oromoo and salivating after the wealth of the Oromoo and Oromiyaa .
This puts the country in a worrisome position .
People are actively talking about the possibility that if the rain does not come soon , the famine that will reach people will cause them to eat each other .
In the Harargee area as we mentioned above , sadly even babies are starving as a result of not having anything to drink .
Cattle do not have food .
In the past , at the end of May and beginning of June in places where it rained twice or three times , people planted crops .
After that , because the rain didn't come , the crops that were planted dried up .
This is the result of not having a proactive government to encourage afforestation and other shortcomings as well as natural causes . But the government as long as it's a government ruling the nation is expected to provide assistance for this crisis and might have intentionally exposed the Oromoo people for this crisis .
What's unbelievable is that the Wayyaanee government is still harassing people by saying that they are still required to pay for the fertilizer and seeds while knowing there is a drought and famine .
This is coming to the people in eastern Shaggar near Fantallee , Adaamii Tulluu , Dugda Bora , Booseet and Adaama .
The Wayyaanee government is demanding the repayment for seeds and fertilizer without sympathizing with the drought and the loss of crops that resulted from it .
While this drought is severely affecting eastern Oromiyaa in eastern Shaggar area , Amaaraa areas , especially northern Goojjam have experienced similar situations where people are fleeing to Sudan and Eritrea and there is growing talk that people are headed towards eating each other if there is no solution in time .
In this situation the Wayyaanee government at this time is depending on the diaspora to conduct the land grabbing in Oromiyaa and divide up the Oromoo lands .
Its known that students and workers have presented their concerns on this topic . But the fact that this crisis is affecting our people has served to encourage the enemy .
But even in the midst of hunger , withstanding all of this , the Oromoo people continue their fight against the Wayyaanee government .
We say that we should stand by our people by getting aid and finding help .
Those that are out to get the lands that Oromoo blood has spilled on by begging the enemy for it will also pay by blood .
The houses that they're building on the bones of Oromoo people are standing on the blood of citizens and will not prosper .
The seeds that they sow in this situation , the wealth they are saving in this will be a curse and consume them and they will not live in it .

Drought is consuming the lives of citizens in Oromia .
Report of Voice of Oromo Liberation .
Due to misguided policy followed by the Woyane faction , the drought crisis in the Ethiopian Empire is exposing the life of the people and of livestock to destruction .
In particular , the fertile and usually green lands of Oromia have been reduced to barren areas because of the wrong policies of the despotic regime in place , while thousands of citizens are suffering for lack of food , having consumed all they have .
Reports reaching us from various Oromia zones confirm that the Woyane government , instead of reaching out to the people with relief food aid and tackling the crisis , is in fact engaged in worsening the situation .
According to these reports , Oromia lands are being robbed by the Woyane while depletion of forest resources by the drought crisis are leaving various Oromia zones barren .
Citizens , as a result , are fleeing their homes because of starvation .
The condition of the climate and famine in Ethiopia....2015 , September 9 , 2015 . The expulsion of students followed claims by the government that the students organized an FDG resistance movement in the towns of Qasso and Uggaa Hordaa , wrote poems that insult the Cabinet , and so on . According to reports from the Qeerroo Oromo movement in Moxee , the expulsion order and warnings were issued by the OPDO . The students ' lot has now become returning to the farm fields , having been expelled from their schools . Residents of Wama Hagalo said the rights of the people of the district are being trodden underfoot .
While no political support came forth to reach out to the affected students , there has also been no electric light service for the past one year since September ; but no political or media support has come forth to help .
The famine and drought that is tormenting citizens in Oromiyaa ...
Report by The Voice of Oromoo Freedom
In the Ethiopian empire as a result of the destructive path the Wayyaanee government is following , famine and drought have taken place and the lives of citizens as well as cattle has been exposed to a massive disaster .
Especially the Oromiyaa lands that were once known for being fertile has been emptied and dried up as a result of this dictatorship's policies , many people have no food to eat and emptied out their reserves and suffer .
Reports that have come in from various Oromiyaa zones indicate that the Wayyaanee government instead of sending aid for the people it says it governs and working to prevent this in the future has been making it even worse .
According to the reports we're getting from many Oromiyaa zones , the areas were exposed to drought and famine because of the robbery of the forest by Wayyaanee that left the land bare and did not get rain which causing the crops that were planted to dry and livestock to starve .
It was also reported that the people have started to leave their homes and flee as a result of this .
The weather conditions and famine in Oromiyaa...2015 = ED September 9,2015 the reason for the banning of the students in the cities of Qassoo and Uggaa Hordaa is that FDG was led in which a poem that insults cadres , the school has stated that it has been given a warning by an OPDO body says the Qeerroo report . In Moxee Oromoo students go back to farming after they finish school . Others who show patriotism for their people are dismissed from school . The residents of Waamaa Hagaloo district have said that in the Empire the human rights of people are violated without any remorse .
After the fake elections of Wayyaanee , those that have been imprisoned have not gotten any political help . From last September until this September , meaning for one year , power has been cut off from the district and no support was provided by any world media .
April 8 , 2016 The sixth round FXG Oromiya resistance movement has continued in Gincii town of West Shaggar zone , in central Oromiyaa .
As round six of the Oromo resistance movement got underway in Gincii town of West Shaggar zone in Central Oromiya , a 9[th ] grade student by the name of Ashetu Worku Morodaa , was sacrificed by the Wayyaanees during shots fired at the demonstrations by Wayyaanee forces . It is reported that many others have been wounded , but their names have not been revealed yet .
As the Oromiyaa resistance movement continues to become widespread and irresistible , the Wayyaanee dictatorial regime seems to have lost all hope , and in desperation it has deployed its Agaazii forces to brutally kill or destroy the people . These forces are kidnapping citizens , arresting them and disturbing the peace and livelihood of the civilian population .
Gincii residents as well as youths have roamed the streets of the town after closing all roads connecting the town to West Oromiya and West Shaggar . Some of the slogans they chanted said , 1 . Release all Oromo prisoners .
2 . Stop the acts of genocide committed by Agaazii forces which began 8 months ago .
3 . OPDO has to step down from power , and also stop subjecting Oromiya to exploitation and robbery .
4 . The government of EPRDF/TPLF , as well as OPDO , should take full responsibility for all the arbitrary and unlawful killings of Oromos in the East Harargee and Arsi zones , and these bodies have to be brought to justice .
We need speedy answers to all of our national rights questions !!
The killings , arrests , and threats of intimidation committed by Agaazii forces and federal police will not stop us from demanding our legitimate rights .

The demonstration staged in Gojo town , Jaldu district of West Shewa , was successful .
All were preparing until Friday .
Everything was ready : those who made flags , those who prepared slogans , were ready .
Starting from Friday night , they dispatched soldiers to every door of Shukete , telling residents not to go out .
They closed every gate .
It was daybreak .
On Saturday they had no way to come together .
The people of Jaldu were ready .
Not only Jaldu but all over Oromia everybody was ready .
The people want to voice their protests , the Woyane are doing everything to stop them .
The enemy does not take a break .
But they get themselves ready to shut doors .
They did not let Shukute move .
They blocked , so people would not to get out .
They kept them from organizing .
One does not see when a dog eats the ear , they say . The rain wouldn't stop , others ran to the hut .
Although it was a market day , no one ran to the market .
People gathered and gathered . The Woyane and their lackeys were closing the roads .
Everybody appeared to go to the market , passing them .
When they approached Gojo town , they took out their flags .
For 25 years , the flag had been hoisted in everybody's heart but forbidden from being hoisted outside .
Everybody wished to hoist this flag in the heart of Finfinnee .
The Qeerroos of Finfinnee did the same on Saturday .
He who had a slogan took out his slogan .
What else can I tell you ; everybody had his slogan , went by coobi hotel , by the office imaaxaa , went up to marraagaja .
Before daybreak , the Woyane and the Oromia Police had occupied the place .
The Gojo town residents could not see each other down at Abyoot .
If two or three people gathered , the soldiers came and dispersed them .
The youth used a tactic .
They scattered and then gathered .
The roads leading to Finfinnee were all closed by the Woyane .
It would be late but it pierces the bomb , as the saying goes . The youth met at the old market place carrying their flags , slogans , and their petitions , gathering a momentum of unity to go to Gojo town .
There is no force that can break a united arm .
When the Woyane realized their unity , they paved the way .
Through sangaa tara , safara guraage , they went up to margaajaa .
The group that came through Kooluu went by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia to the Maraagaja .
When both groups reached Maraagaja , the Woyane army had occupied Maraagaja like a colony of ants .
Hoisting their flags and chanting their slogans , the youth marched to Cillaanqoo .
After joining the Cillaanqoo group , they turned towards the city and started chanting .
Roaring like lions , everybody went home in peace .
One of the slogans chanted was " the OPDOs do not represent us , lackeys don't represent us ."
I have not seen my friends since that Saturday .
The whereabouts of some of them is unknown .
Some are in the hands of the enemy .
I know the enemy does not take care of my friends , but my struggle won't be stopped .
Children of Jaldu , we have rights , we shall win !!!!
The protest conducted in Gojo town , Jaldu district of western Shewa , concluded successfully .
Preparation was underway up to Friday .
Everybody responsible for making flags , designing slogans , and everything were ready .
Starting Friday evening , they stationed soldiers at the entrance of every house and thus confined people to their homes .
Every gate was locked .
Will dawn not come ? Yes , it will .
we could not come together on Sunday either .
All the people in Jaldu were ready .
Not only in Jaldu ; everyone in Oromia was ready .
While the people were ready to make their voices heard , Woyane was getting ready to make them fail .
The enemy will never stop doing mischief .
It places every kind of stumbling block across our path .
They prevented every movement .
They used military force to prevent people from getting out of their houses .
They prevented them from being organized .
Be watchful that dogs do not eat your food and seek shelter from heavy rain , goes the proverb .
Though it was a market day , nobody was going to the market .
People were going to their respective houses while Woyane servants were closing roads .
Everyone was passing by , pretending to be on his or her way to the marketplace .
When they came to the town , they took out their flags .
The flag that had been carried in our minds and hearts for the past 25 years was now being waved openly in broad daylight .
Everybody wished to wave this flag in Finfinnee , the center of Oromia .
That is exactly what Qeerroo did in Finfinnee on Sunday .
Those who had slogans brought them forth .
What could I say , everybody chanted slogans and marched towards the hotel and upwards to Maargajaa .
Woyane soldiers and Oromia police had already occupied the city hall very early in the morning .
The people in Gojo town met each other at the revolutionary square .
Everybody moving around or standing in twos or threes were chased away by Woyane soldiers .
The youth designed a plan .
They came together and dispersed again .
All town gates had been closed by Woyane soldiers .
Adopting the proverb " it will take time but in the end you can pierce a thing ," the dynamic youth chanted their slogans , held up the flags , energized themselves , and in unison marched forward and gathered at the former marketplace of Gojo town .
Nothing can break a united force .
Seeing the strength of the students , Woyane soldiers gave way .
They marched towards Maargajaa through Guraagee areas in Sangaa Taraa .
Those who came later passed the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and marched upwards towards Maargajaa .
When both groups arrived in Maargajaa , Woyane soldiers had already gathered in Maargajaa like ants .
The youth chanted their slogans and , carrying their flags , marched to Cillanqoo .
After coming together with another group at Cillanqoo , they marched downtown in groups and continued chanting their slogans .
They went home peacefully , roaring like lions .
One of the slogans echoed on that day was , " OPDO will not represent us , stooges do not represent us ."
I have not seen my friends since Sunday .
The whereabouts of half of them is not known .
Half of them are in the hands of the enemy .
Though I do not believe that the enemy will treat my friends in a friendly manner , it is my contention that my problems will not be solved through struggle alone .
We , the youth of Jaldu , have the truth and therefore we will win !!!!

She said that Ethiopia got 665 million U.S . dollars in 2014 and was considered to be a fast-growing country and a good U.S . ally . Nevertheless , the problems are ... One of the USAID programs for Ethiopia is to help grow the country's GDP by providing financial assistance .
In order to do this , it was planned to resettle 1.5 million people and prepare the land for industrial development .
" The USA assistance to Ethiopia in politics , finance or skills development is being misused for unintended purposes .
Just like dictatorial regimes , the government is ignoring the wishes of its people , and this leads to instability . The U.S . Congress should investigate and follow up seriously if the money allocated is being used for the intended development purposes .
The American taxpayers ' money should never be used by dictators to violate human rights , aggravate poverty and displace people from their homes and render them refugees elsewhere . The European Union has issued a strong statement regarding human rights violations in Ethiopia ."
Mohammed Ademo , a former Al-Jazeera reporter , was another person who testified about the problems during the peaceful student demonstrations . He reported that about 400 students were killed .
Another witness was Keith Ellison , a Democrat member of Congress representing Minnesota . Thousands of Oromo live in Minnesota .
The Oromo , Ogaden and Ethiopian communities always come to us and tell us about the problems in their country so that we can address it with the American government . Our office has reported on the problems in Oromia and Ogaden and the human rights violations in Ethiopia many times .
We have always brought these issues to the attention of the American government .
When I met with the American ambassador , I spoke about these problems , I raised all of the issues identified by the constituents in my state . For example , like the problem that happened to Yuyyaa . The physical and psychological effects are indescribable . Whenever I meet with the Ethiopian Ambassador or the staff of their Foreign Ministry I bring up these problems and they ask " Why do you interfere with our internal affairs ?" and then we tell them that our constituents have these concerns . It's because of this that the concerned community members show up .
We won't stop talking about this until the problems are solved .. My office always does what it can to raise awareness and address the problems in Ethiopia . If they don't tell us about the problems that they have , we don't know what they are . When you represent a lot of Ethiopian people here , they expect a lot from you .
Ellison says that he would like the attention to not just stop here .
" As I see it here , many people have cameras , many people are recording . I would like you to pass it to as many people as you can , to those who are not here today . Share the problem of human rights violations in Ethiopia through Facebook , Snapchat , and Twitter . We will not rest until the problem in Ethiopia is solved ," said Congressman Ellison .
According to the organizers , Oromo communities from 30 states of the U.S . participated in the demonstration at the Capitol .

Pennsylvania Ave,DC Some recounted what was done to them in the prison while others testified about what they saw being done .
On the verbal testimony session , many people came to tell testimonies to non government organizations and the members of the United States congress . After that , they went on a protest .

The testimony session that Oromoos in Washington DC prepared on April 19,2015 , was held in the office of a member of congress , Keith Ellison , on behalf of the Tom Lantos human rights commission , a commission for human rights established by the American congress .
The discussion was started by the member of the American congress Betty McCollum .
" The current situation that Ethiopia is in cannot continue this way .
The Oromoo people are experiencing great suffering
Communicate what the problems are and what they have been lacking . Someone that goes on peaceful protests is arrested , killed , beaten badly " she said
Afterward Betty continued " Unless the Ethiopian government is held accountable for what it has done , we will strongly urge the Obama administration to stop this great suffering .
This week I will meet with the Ethiopian ambassador in the US and tell him to stop imprisoning people , causing suffering and killing people and respect the rights of humans ,"
According to this member of congress , the American government provides several millions of dollars each year to Ethiopia so that it can become self sufficient in producing crops and strengthen agriculture . In addition " we will ask Ethiopia to protect and strengthen the rights of its people ," she said .
The senior director of the Oakland Institute Anuradha Mittal presented a report to Oromo community and American congress that discussed the crisis Oromiyaa is currently in . The Oakland Institute is in California America and studies social issues related to human rights , agriculture , trade , economy and many other topics .
She also mentioned that Ethiopia received $665 million in aid in 2014 and is considered a developing country and a U.S ally . Yet , the problem is ..." One of the domestic growth programs USAID helps Ethiopia with is increasing the GDP .
In order to accomplish this , one of the plans is to evict 1.5 million people and preparing their land for industry .
" The economic , political , monetary and expertise aid USA is providing to Ethiopia has strayed from its original purpose and is currently headed in a dangerous direction .
It's encouraging those in power to ignore the rights of their people . This in turn will lead towards chaos and lack of peace . The U.S congress should investigate whether the funds provided for economic work is being spent in the same manner as before .
She also added"The American tax payer's money should not be sent to dictators who deny the people their rights , impoverish and force them to flee to foreign lands . The European Union has published a report on the human rights violations in Ethiopia ."

He stated that many times the Oromoo community and Ogaden community of Ethiopia come to tell us about the problems in their country in the hopes that we will communicate it to the American government . His office has often published reports on the human rights issues that take place in Ethiopia .
Every time I meet with the American government , I always speak about the issues they have communicated to me .
I also speak to the American ambassador when I meet him and tell him their concerns . I don't only speak about some problems . I speak about all of the problems my constituents are facing . For example problems such as the one suffered by Yuuyyaa . The reason that people are agonizing is because of the problems they have suffered . They have been through unspeakable suffering . When I see the Ethiopian ambassador I also tell him about these problems . When I meet with many foreign governments they ask me " why are you meddling in our affairs ?" But I tell them that my constituents elected me to speak on their behalf . This is why all these people are here at my office .
he stated,My office will continue to fight until those who have complaints have gotten a solution . My office will speak on the issue in Ethiopia . If they don't tell us about the problems we're facing , we will not know . A lot is expected from those of you who are representing the people of Ethiopia and presenting their problems .
Ellison stated that he doesn't want the complaints to stop here .
" I can see that there are cameras and phones recording . We want you to reach those who are not here with this news . Tell each other about the human rights issues in Etiopia by sharing it through Twitter , Facebook , Snapchat and other social media platforms . We will not rest until this issue has been resolved ."

Waving the student demands aside , the government is instead engaged in attacking the students by mobilizing its Agaazii forces and the Federal Police . It is estimated that over 800 students have been taken to undisclosed places for torture .

On the other , they are plotting to dismiss Oromo students from the school . The Oromo students are summoned and required to fill out forms when they are rounded up and arrested . Under the circumstances , it is just unthinkable for the students to return to their classes .
Meanwhile , the students have warned that the killing and arrest of Oromo students be stopped immediately , that the Wayyaanee forces stationed in the Dippoo area as well as those stationed inside the university be immediately withdrawn , and that the government bodies that have committed these crimes be brought to justice immediately .

The atrocities perpetrated against the students are beyond description , said one student we talked to . Instead of giving a reasonable response to the questions raised by the students , the regime deployed Agazi and federal police forces and is getting rid of the students . An estimated 800 students have been captured and taken to an unknown place .

Students belonging to other ethnic groups did not go back to classes either .

Students are demanding that the killing and jailing of Oromo students must stop immediately and that the Woyane military force stationed around the depot as well as within the university campus must be removed . Government bodies responsible for these atrocities must be brought to justice . It is the stand of the students that if these demands are not fulfilled , they are determined to continue with the struggle .

Finfinnee , October 24 , 2009 ( FBC ) Complete renovation work has been carried out on three of the country's existing sugar factories at a cost of over 50 million Birr .
According to the Sugar Corporation , the factories on which renovation work was undertaken are those that could not produce as much as planned due to a shortage of spare parts , namely Finca'aa , Matahaaraa and Wanjii .

12 American Senators denounced the actions of the Ethiopian government against its people .
WASHINGTON , D.C . -- 12 U.S . Senators drafted a plan of action yesterday , April 21 , 2016 , demanding that the Ethiopian government respect the rights of its citizens and that all parties be represented in the government .
In this plan of action , which is pending approval , the senators denounced the actions that the Ethiopian government is taking against peaceful protesters , opposition parties , journalists and other citizens .
Also mentioned was the fact that citizens are being denied their rights as stated in the country's constitution .
Senator Ben Kardin , member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs , said : " I am shocked by the cruel actions the government forces have taken against the citizens , and I would like to express my sorrow to the families of the people who have been killed by these actions ." He said that the Ethiopian government is using the proclamation that it made to prevent terrorism against its citizens and journalists to curb freedom of expression and political dissent .
Senator Rubio , a former U.S . presidential candidate in 2016 , said on his part that peaceful opposition demonstrators were being imprisoned and killed .
Senator Rubio strongly condemned the human rights violations by the Ethiopian government , and called on President Barak Obama to make respect for human rights the number-one condition regarding relations with the government .
The bill , sponsored by Senator Been and Senator Rubio , was supported by : Senators Mary Kanti Kantwe ( Washington State ), Kristopher Kunsi ( Delaware ), Dick Derbin ( Illinois ), Al Franken ( Minnesota ), Emy Klobuchar ( Minnesota ), Patric Lehel ( Vermont ), Edward Markey ( Massachusetts ), Bob Mendez ( New Jersey ), Patty Murray ( Washington ) and Sherrod Brown ( Ohio ).
The statement by these Senators regarding the bill says that the U.S . works closely with Ethiopia in peacekeeping in Africa and many other areas , and also noted that the U.S . is paying for the African peacekeeping force in Somalia .
Considering the famine situation and the border conflicts , Ethiopia has to work on bringing its people together and not widening the differences .
The bill , signed by 12 senators , requests John Kerry , the Secretary of State of the U.S ., to reconsider assistance given to Ethiopia regarding peacekeeping activities .
This is because of the occurrence of extrajudicial killings in the country carried out by government forces .
According to the bill , the Ethiopian government should conduct a credible investigation and bring these perpetrators to justice .
According to the U.S . Policy Report for Sub-Saharan Africa , issued in 2012 , the focus is on strengthening democratic institutions , respect for human rights , good governance and responsibility .
This is a basis on which to improve the lives of the citizens .
However , the bill says , " Democracy in Ethiopia is obstructed and the rights of citizens are violated .
A person with differing political views , leaders of political parties , demonstrators and journalists are threatened , detained or killed without charges or due process ."
12 U.S . Senators denounced the actions that the Ethiopian government has taken against its people .

12 United States senators condemned the actions the Ethiopian government took on its citizens .
WASHINGTON , DC - Yesterday , April 21,2016 12 United States senators passed a draft resolution urging the Ethiopian government to respect the rights of its citizens and involve a body that represents everyone in its administration .
In the draft resolution that is up for decision , the senators condemned the actions Ethiopian government forces took against peaceful protestors , journalists and the citizens of its country .
That the citizens were not allowed to exercise the rights the laws of the country provide them as well .
Ben Cardin , the senator for the state of Maryland and head of the senate foreign relations committee stated " The actions the Ethiopian government forces took against the citizens of the country make me shudder , I want to express my sympathies to the families of the people that died because of these actions ." He also stated that the Ethiopian government is using the laws it passed to fight terrorism against journalists and citizens of the nation ; in addition , it also uses it to suppress the freedom of self expression and right to have any desired political opinion .
Senator Rubio , another senator that was campaigning to be elected as the president of America in 2016 , in his part stated " demonstrators that protest in peace have been imprisoned without committing a crime and killed ".
Senator Rubio strongly condemned Ethiopia's violation of the rights that people are naturally entitled to as humans and asked President Obama to work to bring up human rights and the political condition for discussion in the relations that the United States and Ethiopia have with each other .
Those who support the draft resolution with Senator Ben Cardin and Rubio are : Senator Mary Katwi ( Washington State ), Senator Christopher Koons ( state of Delaware ), Senator Dick Durbin ( State of Illinois ), Senator Al Frankin ( Minnesota ) Senator Amy Klobuchar ( Minnesota ), Senator Patrick Leahy ( Vermont ), Senator Edward Marquis ( Massachusetts ) Senator Bob Menendez ( New Jersey ), Senator Patty Murry ( Washington ) and Senator Sherrod Brown(Ohio )
In a statement that the senators released regarding this draft resolution the senators said " The United States is working closely with Ethiopia on various issues including peace keeping efforts in Africa ." In addition , they reminded that it is the United States that funds Ethiopia's involvement in the work that the African Union conducts in Somalia .
The draft resolution that states that considering the condition of the drought and border related issues that exist in the country , Ethiopia now more than ever must work to make sure the people in the country live together in harmony and not try to create division also states that the government of the county must respect the rights of the people in order to get out of these issues .
The resolution that was drafted by these 12 senators asks the Secretary of State John Kerry to revise the aid that America provides to Ethiopia for efforts related to peace keeping issues .
And this is because the citizens of the country are being illegally killed by the government forces .
It states that the Ethiopian government must immediately stop these actions and conduct a credible investigation ; It must also bring the forces that were committing these killings to justice .
As the draft resolution outlines , one of the goals of the United States ' plan for sub-Saharan Africa that was issued in 2012 is to strengthen the efforts of organizations that work towards spreading democracy and the protection of human rights as well as to make sure that good and responsible government grows .
The result of this is the improvement of the lives of the citizens .
However , states the draft resolution " the condition of democracy in Ethiopia is not good , people's human rights are being violated .
threatening , arresting without cause and killing people who have a different political opinion , representatives of political parties , protestors and journalists has continued ."
12 United States senators condemned the actions the Ethiopian government took on its citizens .

#FXG - Oromia - News - February 17 , 2017
February 17 , 2017 The war of invasion started by the Wayanees and Somalia's Liyyuu police on Oromia's border last January has continued in an intensified way .
The war of invasion , which was initiated by the Wayanees along with the Liyyuu police , began with skirmishes in 15 districts and five zones of Oromia at first , but later spread to southern Oromia , especially the Nagele area , beginning February 14 , 2017 .
During the bitter fight conducted by the Oromos in defense of their land , they killed 43 enemy soldiers and wounded 27 others . The Wayanee forces are mostlycomprised of Tigrean nationals , while the members of the Liyyuu police are all Somalis .
Reports confirm that a number of weapons have been captured from the enemy .
Meanwhile , Oromos also continue to pay a heavy sacrifice as they have already lost 18 of their men , while 20 others have been wounded , according to SBO news .
During a battle that raged in the Babillee area on February 16 , 2017 , six enemy soldiers were killed and eight others wounded .
It is also reported that five Kalashnikov rifles were captured from the enemy .
( Via Adem Misoma , February 17 , 2017 ) Wayanee messengers Lammaa Magarsaa and Abbaa Duulaa Gammadaa , acting under the cover of fighting corruption , are busy visiting Oromia in an effort to implement Wayanee's so-called Finfinnee Master Plan in a very deceitful manner .
According to the latest reports , OPDO officials , including Lammaa Magarsaa and Abbaa Duulaa Gammadaa , who have thrown the full weight of their support and solidarity behind the Wayanees all along ,, have been running up and down in Oromia to identify and take action against those that oppose the Master Plan in towns like Burraayyuu , Sulultaa , Sabbataa , Laga Xaafoo , Galan , Duukam , Adaama and Shashamannee .
The same reports confirmed that all those individuals , both within the OPDO and outside of it , who are discovered opposing the Finfinnee Master Plan are being identified , told that they have serious problems and then hauled off to prison .
The Wayanees have been dispatching their agents under the pretext of searching for corrupt people . They have been sending up to 30 of their agents to each town to expose , as they say , people suspected of engaging in corruption . The whole idea is to identify people who are opposed to the policies of the despotic Wayanee regime and to place them under arrest .
The Wayanee messengers who have been selected from among the officials of the OPDO to implement Wayanee policies are : 1 . Lammaa Magarsaa , 2 . A/Duulaa Gammadaa , 3 . Warqinaa Gabayyoo , 4 . Hirut Biraasaa , 5 . Dammaslaash G/Mikaa'el , and others .
Reports also confirm that Lammaa Magarsaa , with his butter-coated rhetoric , has been promising the people , without any sense of shame and regret , what he himself cannot implement . He was simply telling the people what his TPLF masters dictated to him .
Other reports warn the Oromo people not to be carried away by the rhetoric of Lammaa Magarsaa , who is only trying to please his masters in the EPRDF/TPLF and prolong their stay in power at the expense of the well-being of the Oromo people . In the name of the anti-corruption drive , the Wayanee agents are devising ways and means of destroying anybody , in the OPDO or elsewhere , who dares oppose Wayanee policies .
It is also reported that Lammaa Magarsaa , Birhaanuu Haayiluu and Ittafaa Tolaa are all friends of Abbaa Duulaa Gammadaa , and that they are opening their mouths wide to swallow the Oromo people .
It is to be noted that the Wayanee/TPLF clique and their agents aim to destroy all genuine Oromo nationalists who are opposed to the Wayanees and thereby implement the so-called Finfinnee Master Plan .
That being the case , we call on those genuine OPDO members who have concern for the Oromo people and those who are awakened to a realization about the fallacies of people like Lammaa Magarsaa to heighten their vigilance even more than before , and to frustrate all enemy schemes in a united struggle .
We would also like to call on our people to beware of those who , while talking a great deal about Oromo rights , are clandestinely scheming to destroy the identity of the Oromos . We call on our people to turn a deaf ear to all of the treacherous propaganda of the enemy .

In this situation it was reported that the Oromoo people fighting for its land has killed a total of over 43 members of special police that are Somali by blood and Wayyaanee army which includes tigre and injured over 27 of them as well .
They have also been able to disarm the enemy from the weapons it was using against them in their own land .
An SBO report that we received states that As a result of the fight that Oromoo people are carrying out to protect their land 18 Oromoo people have been martyred and 20 have been wounded .
February 16,2017 In Baabbilee 6 were killed and 8 wounded as a result of an attack that was carried out on special police .
5 AK-47s have also been confiscated .
Via Adem Misoma February 16,2017 ) It has been discovered that Wayyaanee messengers Lammaa Magarsaa and Abbaa Duulaa Gammadaa have been using strategies and secretly carrying on the Addis Ababa master plan .
According to internal sources , new OPDO representatives that have been appointed recently and those that have previously been loyal to TPLF such as the one called the president of Oromiyaa Lammaa Magarsaa and A/Duulaa Gammadaa have been on a strategic campaign in cities such as Buraayyuu , Sulultaa , Sabbataa , Laga Xaafoo , Galaan , Dukam , Adaamaa and Shashimanne to put the people they think will oppose the decision in prison .
The news reveals that they've started to imprison all of those who protest the master plan for the city of Finfinnee both from within OPDO and from the general population on charges of conspiracy stating that they have problems .
While they have been sending up to 30 people to investigate possible conspiracies and close the books to each city , its made clear that these people are not actually there to investigate but to round up those who protest against the dictatorial tactics of Wayyaanee and OPDO representatives and prepare them for imprisonment .
The report clarifies that the Wayyaanee messengers that are called OPDO representatives that have spearheaded this antagonistic objective are the so called president of Oromiyaa 1 . Lammaa Magarsaa , and those like 2 . A/Duulaa Gammadaa , 3 . Warqinaa Gabayyoo , 4 . Hiruut Biraasaa , 5 . Dammallash G/Mikaaʼel .
The report recalls that Lammaa Magarsaa was seen and heard speaking daily on the media about things that he can't actually accomplish and would run counter to the orders of his masters the TPLF and thus would not have a chance of taking place to sweet talk the Oromoo people into giving up their fight for their rights .
The warning that alerted our people to be weary of listening to the propaganda the pretender Lamma Magarsaa spews , traveling up and down , to keep Oromoo under the foreign subjugation of TPLF/EPRDF , also confirms that Wayyaanee converts plan to conduct a mass imprisonment campaign under the label ‘ anti-corruption ’ in all the cities they’ve been sent against OPDO members that oppose their actions and the people they hate .
The report reveals that these three named Lammaa , Birhaanuu Haayiluu and Ittafaa Tolaa are friends of Abba Duulaa and have plotted with the organization that has opened its mouth to eat the Oromoo people to start this campaign .
According to the report Wayyaanee/TPLF through its messengers plans to enact its Finfinnee master plan by taking out OPDO members that oppose this action and cleansing the people that are aware under the guise of corruption .
The report advises that OPDO members that have the attention of the people and the people that have noticed the adversarial tactics of Lamma Magarsaa and Wayyaanee should stay vigilant and aware of this work and start work to sabotage it ahead of time .
It highlights the message that Lammaa Magarsaa , who speaks of the suffering of Oromoos but conspires behind the scenes must be exposed and our people should be made aware of the propaganda of the enemy’s messengers and not relent from the revolution they have been leading .

This week's report from all over Oromiya
This week's report from all over Oromiya
January 03 , 2016 ( Qeerroo ) -- This is a point in time when the Wayyaane government , working under the pretext of the so-called state of emergency ( command post ), is killing or arresting the Oromo people en masse . Besides this , the Wayyaanees are very busy displacing the Oromos from their fatherland , and forcing them to flee to neighboring countries . It is to do away with such gross injustices that the brave Oromo youths are daily confronting the enemy to strengthen the national resistance movement .
Last week , the existing regime , whose system of rule is nearing total collapse , tried to force the Oromo people to show active participation in the celebration of the so-called Day of Nations and Nationalities . But the Oromo resistance movement did its homework in parts of Oromiya , telling the people to ignore the Wayyaane calls , and the day was paid very little attention . Earlier , the Oromos had observed the day with celebration and displays by chanting slogans . This time around , all the Oromos gave the day minimal attention , and this annoyed the Wayyaanes .
Among the places in Oromiya where this celebration was denied attention by the Oromos are : Naqamtee in Wallagga , the University of Wallagga , Nuunnuu Qumbaa , Shaamboo , Baakkoo , Mandii , Najjoo , Gimbii , Amboo , the University of Amboo , Gincii , the University of Jimma , and many other towns .
Similarly , the Wayyaanees , who are shocked by the Oromo resistance movement , continue to deploy their forces , ordering them to evict families from their homes , killing people and stealing the property of the people . The enemy is raping Oromo girls , making them their playthings . They are also picking up Oromos who have strong nationalist feelings and subjecting them to special attacks and torture . In the name of security , they search thehouses , they even untie the garment belts of mothers and steal whatever little they have .
**************** Because of the ever-increasing popular resistance against this cruel despotic regime in all of Oromia , the Woyanes are running here and there throughout the cities of Oromia and are conducting searches . Kidnapping and forcefully disappearing people just because they express their feelings against the injustices , or just for being an Oromo , is a common practice throughout Oromia . The popular resistance is beyond the control of the Woyane regime , which is shaking and cornered at the moment .
***************** During this week , the Wayyaanee government has been dragging people to prison , angered by the refusal of the Oromos to come out and observe the event . The government's security agents have been going around the town and picking out those believed to have strong nationalist feelings . Foremost among these towns is the town of Naqamtee .
**************** In related news , it was decided earlier by the Wayyanes that the Day of Nations and Nationalities would be observed on the campuses of all Oromiyaa universities . But this scheme was totally foiled , in keeping with the tradition of other Oromo youths to frustrate the enemy's wishes .
**************** The TPLF hyenas are now confused as to what to do next , in the face of the ever-strengthening Oromo resistance movement .
Oromos everywhere have a strong aversion to the Wayyaanee government .
As the Oromo resistance movement is getting stronger and stronger every passing day , we call on others to come out and help their brothers .
**************** Meanwhile , federal forces have tightened their grip on university students , accusing them that they are all behind the resistance of the Oromo people . Even so , this has not demoralized the students , but has instead motivated them to struggle even harder .
**************** The Wayyaane forces have been stationed on the university campuses , knowing that this would intimidate the students , but all in vain . That being the case , the Wayyaanees continue to provoke the students so that they will have a pretext for torturing them further . They are already beating , arresting and torturing the students for the slightest offence .
****************
The invasion forces of the Wayyaanees , far from being apologetic for whatever injustices they have committed so far , including the killing of thousands , are continuing to kill and arrest the Oromo people .
Meanwhile , the invasion forces have been identifying Oromo students on the various campuses and subjecting them to arrest and kidnapping for no other cause except their ethnic background .
Accordingly , a first-year veterinary student by the name of Hundee Tafarii was kidnapped this week by security agents as he was pursuing his studies , and his whereabouts are unknown . Hundee comes from Dembi Dollo , and he was arrested solely because of his ethnic background , observers say .
The week's reports from all over Oromiyaa
The week's reports from all over Oromiyaa
December 9,2016 ( Qeerroo ) - At a time when this terrorist Wayyaanee government is killing Oromoo people , sending the remaining citizens to prison en masse and evicting the others from their land and the land of their forefathers forcing them to flee their home by taking advantage of this state of emergency declaration , the youth all over Oromiyaa have started a strong national revolution and are leading a struggle against the enemy .
This week this government whose regime is disintegrating under the banner of a national festival is forcing Oromoo people from all over Oromiyaa to celebrate this holiday by deploying its goons to force them to celebrate , failed at having this event all over Oromiyaa because of the revolution that is currently being led by the youth and the resistance being carried out by the people . The Wayyaanee government who previously been blasting its propaganda under the guise of this national festival now has had this event ruined as a result of the resistance Qeerroo has facilitated in all the zones of Oromiyaa .
Out of the zones in Oromiyaa where the national festival was not celebrated as a result of the Qeerroo resistance are cities like Naqamtee , inside Wallaggaa University , Nuunnuu Qumbaa , Shaambuu city , Baakkoo , Mandii , Najjoo , Gimbii , Amboo , Amboo University and in the awwaaroo branch , Giincii , Jimmaa and Jimmaa University and throughout other Oromiyaa cities . The terrorist government , who was angered at the failure of this event has deployed its forces en masse throughout Oromiyaa and is constantly harassing the people .
In a similar manner , as a result of the strengthening of the resistance , the robbery and the army's inhumane acts it's been carrying out in many Oromiyaa zones against the people have continued . The mass kidnapping , and torture of Oromoos just for being Oromoo has continued throughout Oromiyaa . Its been reported that the army of the Wayyaanee invaders have been robbing widows and committing inhumane acts in the name of searches .
**************** As a result of the strengthening of the resistance , in many Oromiyaa zones , this monstrous Wayyaanee regime has been going through cities and carrying out brutal searches without any mercy for the people . The forced disappearance of Oromoo citizens for caring about their people and for being Oromoo themselves has continued throughout all of Oromiyaa .
**************** In this week , as a retaliation for the failure of the national festival , the Wayyaanee government has deployed its goons to round up and imprison the people in many cities throughout Oromiyaa . The report that Qeerroo provides us also states that there are Wayyaanee dogs who are reporting people to the enemy by going through the city and rounding up Oromoos who have suffered just for the sake of being Oromoo . This act of enemity has primarily targeted the city of Naqamtee to set an example for the rest of the zones .
**************** In a similar manner this week it was decided that the national festival will forcibly be celebrated in all of the universities in Oromiyaa . However , as a result of the resistance of the youth that are students in these universities , the plan to celebrate this national festival has been derailed .
**************** At this time , as a result of the Oromoo people's resistance , the TPLF hyenas do not know what to do .
Because of the hatred the Oromoo people have for the Wayyaanee government , the people throughout all of Oromiyaa hold their nose in disgust of this terrorist government .
The information we receive from the youth throughout Oromiyaa confirm the reports we have made regarding the people's resistance coordinated across the region .
*************** The federal forces in the university compounds are provoking peaceful students only there to attend classes and claiming that they were provoking them and harassing them constantly . The young heroes on campus at this time are continuing their strong resistance and continuing their struggle with this oppressive government .
**************** The federal force that has settled in the campus is harassing students without cause by putting a checkpoint at the gate of the compound . The job of the forces that have settled in at the compound has become to call students to them and create an unprovoked conflict and carry out mass beatings .
****************
The army of the Wayyaanee invaders has no sympathy for Oromoos has continues its insatiable imprisonment and killing of Oromoos and refuses to acknowledge or apologize for the tens of thousands of killings it carried out previously .
Similarly the terrorist government has created trumped up charges against the students in the compound only because they're Oromoo and used these charges to send them off to prison to silence them .
As a result , a student called Hundee Tafarii from Dambi Doolloo who is currently in his first year studying veterinary medicine , was kidnapped by security forces and disappeared . Hundee is a student who was targeted because he is Oromoo and was thrown in prison without fault .
Peace is achievable only when the peoples ' demands for respect of their rights are answered .
( Statement by ABO ) The great and honorable people of Oromo have conducted an uninterrupted struggle , especially over the past four months , to break the yoke of slavery . They have conducted their struggle in keeping with existing international laws , even without getting any support from third parties . In doing so , the Oromos have managed to make the global population and even their own fellow countrymen aware of their real concerns .
In the process , the maturity and gentleness demonstrated by the Oromos are really worthy of special admiration .
The resistance put up by the Oromo people , especially the young , is unique in the history of Ethiopia and is a source of pride to the Oromo natives and all peace-loving peoples .
Understandably , the resistance has thus qualified to become headline news in the international media .
While the Oromo people have always conducted their revolution in a peaceful manner , the enemy has twisted this truth around and tried to give the impression that the resistance is terroristic in nature . However , these efforts by the enemy to tarnish the good name of the peace-loving Oromos have fallen on deaf ears and failed to convince the Ethiopian and international communities .
The Wayaanee government , which has made it a tradition to kill , beat , arrest , kidnap and torture peaceful citizens , has tried in vain to portray the Oromo people in a bad light in the eyes of the global public . The Wayaanee efforts have proven unacceptable .
The Wayaanees seem to have realized that their evil desire to stifle the truth and point accusing fingers at others will take them nowhere . It is based on this realization that the Wayaanees , through their nominal parliament , have waged an open war on the Oromos in the name of what they call from their command post a state of emergency .
The fact that the Wayaanees have stayed in power , up until now , only by kidnapping and setting people against one another to weaken their unity is all too evident .
Let us now wake up and disregard all enemy deception !
Now the people are engaged in gaining respect for their rights .
We cannot continue to live with hopes that are unachievable . We have to intensify our struggle in all four areas of the country .
It is to be recalled that last March 10 , 2016 , Hailemariam Dessalegn publicly admitted in a speech to Parliament that the Ethiopian government and the ruling party must take all the responsibility for the problems of this country .
He stated that the government has been unable to give answers to questions raised by the people , and that the level of consciousness of the people has surpassed that of the government .
He also warned that , unlike in the past , it will not be possible for the government to continue to perch on the shoulders of the people at will and suck the blood of the people by sticking to the people like ticks .
He reiterated that , after all , the existing problems emanate from the absence of a system of good governance .
It is amazing that Hailemariam has just come to this realization that the Ethiopian people are conscious enough or are capable of knowing what is good for them and what is not .
It is only the Wayaanees that deny the fact that the people are capable of beating the enemy in any fair elections .
When the people complain that their voices have been silenced , they will be subjected to killing and harassment in broad daylight . The Wayaanees know that they cannot win any elections by fair means . The people fully realize that the Wayaanees will steal votes by whatever means to ensure their stay in power .
The struggle that the Oromo people have conducted ever since 1991 has proved that the Wayaanee government by its very nature is against democracy and against peace .
The Wayaanees have replied to all Oromo questions about rightswith repression , kidnapping and the use of force .
The enemy has reached this point in time only through arbitrary arrests , killings , beatings and threats of intimidation .
Even so , these injustices have not caused the Oromo people to flinch , or to kneel at the feet of the enemy .
It is becoming clearer than ever before that the Oromos will not bow to enemy dictates and threats of intimidation , even as the enemy has tried hard to label peace-loving Oromos as terrorists .
The enemy effort to separate the Oromo people from the OLF has failed miserably , as Oromos continue to chant pro-OLF slogans and carry their flag during protest demonstrations .
Oromos have always made their stance clear that the OLF , far from being terrorists , are human rights activists . And it is this , more than anything , that has broken the backbone of the enemy .
Today , the Oromo people are being killed , or arrested for the simple " offence " of demanding their rights and their national honor .
The Oromos are being hunted down just like animals only because they are demanding their legitimate national rights based on the country's constitution .
The Oromos are being hauled into prison only because they object to being ruled by the Wayaanee dictators .
The OPDO is a creation of the Wayaanees and can by no means represent the Oromo people . The Oromos are only oppressed because they have voiced their demands for self-government .
The problems facing Ethiopia now are rooted in the Wayaanee system . The Wayaanee alone are responsible for the current mess .
It is the Wayaanee system that has obstructed the way to good governance .
It is simply impossible to create good governance in a system where anti-democratic forces are in power .
The enemy has refused to listen to Oromos who maintain that they cannot be ruled by Wayaanees .
" OPDO cannot rule us !"
That is what they used to say and continue to say now .
A government that is not willing to listen to the voice of its citizens will only exacerbate the problems and bring the country to a dead end .
Dividing Oromia into eight zones and bringing it under the military administration of Samora Yunus can bring neither good governance nor peace to the country .
Posing as a democratic government and establishing martial law in Oromia will only worsen the problem and not solve anything .
At a meeting held on 04/03/2016 , under the chairmanship of General Samora Yunus , it was declared as follows , in an effort to set up a military council which would bring Oromia under military rule .
Military Council of Wayaanee Amharic version .
Peace will only be found by those who can answer the Oromoo people's demand for rights .
( Statement given by ABO ) The grand and well respected Oromo nation , has made it clear to other peoples in Ethiopia that through the struggle to end slavery that it led continuously for the past four months , it only fights for its natural rights supported by international law and has no animosity towards any other peoples .
The discipline and maturity the Oromoo people have shown during this struggle is admirable .
The Oromo people and especially the youth showed a determination that's never been seen in the history of Ethiopia and made all Oromoos as well as those that stand for peace proud .
The culmination of all of this has , by bringing out the truth and gaining sympathy , brought it to the forefront of world news .
The efforts the enemy made to paint the struggle of the Oromoo people that started in a peaceful manner as anti peace has failed to get acceptance by other peoples in Ethiopia as well as other people's foreign to the regime .
The attempts the Wayyaanee government made to tie the questions about the merciless killings , mass beatings and forced disappearances to a religious cause to make it hated by other peoples has also not gotten support .
When the Wayyaanee government realized that denying the truth and pointing fingers at others is not going to work , it declared a war to be led by the `Command Post ' and publicly revealed to the made-up parliament that the error was done by the ruling party .
Everyone knows and understands that the Wayyaanee government has gotten this far by forcibly silencing the people's demand for rights and creating rifts between the peoples so they won't unite in their struggle .
But today the peoples need to be aware of the government's conspiracy !
They've started fighting for their rights .
They've decided not to be lied to and given empty promises and started their struggle in all four corners of the country .
March 10,2016 in the speech H/Maariyam Dessaleny made to the federal parliament , he has admitted that the government and ruling party is responsible for the issues that are apparent in Ethiopia .
He stated that the ruling party cannot provide answers for the questions that the questions the people are actively asking .
In addition it has admitted that it has been robbing the people and sucking their blood dry like leaches .
It stated that the solution for the problems that are appearing everywhere is to be able to " extend good government "
Its incredible that H/Maariyaam is just now realizing that the Ethiopian people are self aware and capable of understanding what will work best for them .
Its only Wayyaanee that denies that in the elections that were held under difficult circumstances that the people have tried to remove it more than once .
Even if Wayyaanee pretends not to know that it has kept its power by killing those that protest by saying that their voice was stolen en masse in broad daylight ,
This in addition to the Oromoo people's movement that started in 1991 has exposed that the Wayyaanee government is the enemy of peace and democracy .
The answer to the Oromoo people's demand for rights has only been forced silencing by Wayyaanee .
It got here by killing , imprisoning , beating and terrorizing .
But today all of this is not making the Oromoo people kneel .
Being falsely accused of terrorism and being anti peace has also not forced the Oromoo people to kneel .
Attempts to separate the Oromoo people from OLF have also failed as confirmed by the songs , chants , and the flags the Oromoo people carry when they go out to protest .
By making it known that OLF is fighting for their rights , they are blunting the terrorism allegations against it .
Today , Oromoo people are being killed and rounded up to prison for knowing and demanding their rights .
They are being hunted like animals for asking their rights be fulfilled based on the law of the land .
It was taken by the thousands to prison because it opposed the dictatorship of Wayyaanee .
Its being threatened because it said that OPDO is an organization Wayyaanee created and trained ; it's the messenger and representative of Wayyaanee and not that of the Oromoo , we must govern ourselves .
The problem that has a stranglehold on Ethiopia is the Wayyaanee regime . Wayyaanee is the only one accountable .
The Wayyaanee regime created an administration that lacked the capacity to have good government .
A good administration cannot be expected until this anti democratic fascist regime is uprooted .
They refused to listen but the Oromoo people " will not be governed by Wayyaanee !"
" OPDO will not govern us !"
has been saying this for this reason .
The solution this government that doesn't know how to listen to its people has planned will only lead to worsening conditions and chaos .
Dividing Oromiyaa into 8 zones and putting it under the army of Saamooraa Yunus does not result in a good administration .
Calling itself a democratic government and then dispersing the army throughout Oromiyaa makes the current situation worse not better .
Oromiyaa was handed over for rule by the minister of defense and on the 04/03/2016 meeting led by general Samoora Younnus of the army council , there was not even one Oromoo present as a token as reported below .
Wayyaanee war council Amharic version
The TPLF/EPRDF system , by striving to reduce the rightful status of nationals to second-class citizenship , is only facilitating conditions for its self-destruction .
The TPLF/EPRDF system , by striving to reduce the rightful status of nationals to second-class citizenship , is only facilitating conditions for its self-destruction .
The Peoples ' Alliance for Freedom and Democracy ( PAFD ) has issued a report concerning support needed for dozens of citizens following a disaster .
Heavy destruction has been caused upon Ethiopian nationals including mothers , fathers , brothers , and grandparents living on the outskirts of Finfinnee city following a landslide at a garbage disposal site .
Even today , the tragedy is being repeated , subjecting other communities to untold suffering .
This is a time when TPLF government and security forces have imposed a state of emergency on Oromo peoples and other nationals ; it is a time when cholera outbreak is devouring Somalia nationals in the Ogaden because of minimal attention paid to them ; it is a time when children of Gambella are being killed or abducted by foreign forces . It is indeed saddening that the Ethiopian people are still subjected to ongoing destruction under the rule of the so-called TPLF government .
The organization of the Peoples ' Alliance for Freedom and Democracy , on behalf of all struggling peoples , has conveyed messages of condolences to relatives of the deceased .
Although no government or organization has yet claimed responsibility for the disaster , we do not hesitate to go ahead and hold TPLF answerable for the disaster .
While homeless and poor people have been buried alive under the rubble of the landslides , hundreds of others have been rendered homeless .
The TPLF system , waving aside the advice given it by prominent personalities for finding a solution , has instead stayed passive , thereby maximizing the agony of hundreds of citizens caused by hardships and homeless life .
That being the case , the loss of over 68 lives following the landslide disaster that took place on March 11 , 2017 , in a garbage disposal area on the outskirts of Finfinnee , is enough evidence to prove the indifference and weak system of rule of the despotic TPLF now in power in Ethiopia .
According to other incoming reports , the whereabouts of many others are not known .
These victims are among those completely marginalized by the 26-year old TPLF-EPRDF regime . Others are citizens who have already been displaced from the land bequeathed to them by their ancestors . The land thus confiscated from them in the name of investment is being transferred to generals and other officials of the TPLF .
In any case , the government in power now is fully responsible for the mess .
We , members of the Peoples ' Alliance for Freedom and Democracy , would like to extend our deepest sorrow over the heart-breaking destruction and agony caused upon oppressed peoples by the government in place .
We also call on all Ethiopian peoples to pool their resources and extend their helping hands to the affected peoples .
The government in power needs to be condemned for robbing the properties of the people instead of working in the interest of the lives of citizens . It needs to be condemned for denying citizens first-aid services and other necessities .
We also call on the Ethiopian people to stand united in the struggle to topple the 26-year old TPLF system and to bring about a genuine system to replace this man-eating system .
The despotic TPLF rule should be held answerable for refusing to come to the rescue of affected peoples .
We demand that TPLF pays everything necessary , without any pre-conditions , to families whose lives have been destroyed for lack of governmental attention and care .
We wish every comfort and blessing to all those who lost their relatives because of lack of concern by TPLF and its henchmen .
The Peoples ' Alliance for Freedom and Democracy would like to reiterate that it will continue to advocate for the cause of oppressed peoples of Ethiopia up until the time that their rights are secured .

The TPLF/EPRDF regime is lowering the people to second class citizens and preparing the situation for their extinction .
The TPLF/EPRDF regime is lowering the people to second class citizens and preparing the situation for their extinction .
PEOPLES ALLIANCE FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ( PAFD ) statement on the extinction facing many citizens by the Peoples ' Alliance for Freedom and Democracy .
In Ethiopia , fathers , siblings , grandfathers and relatives that cannot find someone to help them are thrown to the landfill , the poor that live on the outskirts of Finfinnee have experienced a sad loss .
Even today , the sad history that happened again has touched the community in a different way .
The mass killing that's being carried out on the Oromoo people and other Ethiopian peoples by forces under the protection of the TPLF , the cholera epidemic that is causing the deaths of the people of the Somaalii Ogaadeen , the people of Gaambeellaa that are being killed and disappeared by foreign forces , the people of Ethiopia under the TPLF that considers itself a government are mourning the loss of thousands .
PEOPLES ALLIANCE FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ( PAFD ) expresses its deepest sympathies to the people that have experienced such great losses on behalf of the people in the struggle .
Even if its known that the government or the responsible party is not doing anything , we will not stop putting pressure on the TPLF regime to take responsibility for the disasters that took place .
As a result of the garbage landslide that buried hundreds of homes and shelters , many citizens have become homeless .
The TPLF regime refused to listen to experts that urged it to take action to solve this problem and caused the loss of citizens .
the massive garbage landslide that happened on the night of March 11 , 2017 in the capital city of Ethiopia ( Finfinnee/Addis Ababaa ) and claimed the lives of over 68 people , is evidence of the TPLF Ethiopia's ruling party's refusal to provide adequate attention .
In addition , according to reports , the whereabouts of many others is unknown .
Some are the people ignored by the TPLF/EPRDF regime that was in power for the past 26 years , while others are those whose ancestral lands were stolen and were uprooted in the name of investment to be given to the generals and authorities of TPLF .
The ruling government is responsible for both of them .
We PEOPLES ALLIANCE FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ( PAFD ) express our sympathies for the sad and disturbing disaster that has affected the oppressed community that was ignored by the ruling regime .
We invite the Ethiopian people to hold hands and join in the assistance of the people in such a sad circumstance .
The regime that robs the wealth of the area around the capital without caring for the lives and wellbeing of the people should be rebuked for its inability to provide emergency aid to its citizens .
PUFD invites the peoples of Ethiopia to rise up against the TPLF regime that has not represented the people and carelessly been committing atrocities for the past 26 years and remove it from power .
We also say that it should be held accountable for not being able to protect its citizens from such disasters .
We ask that it provide reparations for families who've lost members and been uprooted as a result of the carelessness of the TPLF .
We wish that those that lost their lives due to the carelessness of the TPLF regime throughout the country rest in peace .
PEOPLES ALLIANCE FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ( PAFD ) state that our fight will not stop until all the needs of the oppressed people in Ethiopia are met .

The Oromo are in big trouble both at home and abroad , according to a Reuters documentary .
Reuters released a documentary about the problems the Oromo face in the country , as well as in the countries in which they take refuge .
The Reuters documentary describes the serious problems the Oromo face along the way while escaping political persecution in Ethiopia .
According to the documentary , the Oromo are mistreated in the neighboring countries where they take refuge , and others die in the Sahara desert and on the Mediterranean Sea .
Those who get a chance to reach Europe after surviving the dangerous journey cannot overcome the challenges of life .
The reason is that many European countries still do not pay enough attention to the Oromo problem .
This Reuters documentary also emphasizes that the Oromo in Ethiopia are in a very difficult situation .
It reveals that about 500 people have been killed since November 2015 .
The action that Fayyisa Lelisa took during the Rio Olympics has had a tremendous effect on the global community's attention to Oromo issues , according to the documentary .
The documentary of Reuters says that the Oromos are in trouble both at home and abroad :
Reuters released a documentary showing the hardship the Oromos face both at home and abroad .
The Reuters documentary clearly shows that the Oromos face great challenges on their way to foreign countries while escaping from the political burden in their country .
According to the documentary many Oromos suffer maltreatment in neighboring countries and many of them die in the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean Sea .
Even though the fortunate Oromos arrive in Europe after passing through mony ups and downs , they could not get lasting resolution for their problems .
That is because many European countries do not give enough attention to Oromo refugees .
The Reuters documentary indicates that the Oromos live in Ethiopia under harsh condition .
As of November 2015 , more than 500 people were killed .
The Reuters documentary also shows that the action of Feyisa Lelisa at Rio Olympic has helped the situation of Oromo to get the recognition and attention of the international community .
In Awodaay , the Wayyaanees have killed five Oromo children and wounded many others .
Five Oromo children lost their lives following atrocious actions taken by Agaazii forces and their accomplices against peaceful people in the town of Awodaay today .
According to reports from Haramaayaa Hospital , many others have been wounded as a result .
The Oromo children that were brutally victimized by bullets of the Wayyaanees are : Fandishee Naasir , Saifuddiin Abdusabur Hassoo , Obsaa Yaasin , Munaa Turkii and Firoomsaa Ahmadsadiq .
Among those killed is a 9-year-old child .
Apart from those slain , many others have been wounded .
It is widely reported that Abduu Idris , the chairman of 02 kebele in the town of Awodaay , spilt the blood of Oromo children with the guns that he was armed with by the Wayyaanees .
Although the people have set his house on fire in anger , he has now taken refuge with his masters , who trained him and armed him with weapons .
Awodaay now finds itself besieged by Agaazii forces and being bombarded by heavy shelling .
Even so , the people of the town have not surrendered .
They spent the whole day condemning the Wayyaanees , remembering the child victims and defending their rights .
Reports coming in from other locations , including from the residents of the town of Haramaayaa , have been expressing their solidarity with the people being attacked in the town of Awodaay .
In a related story , road transport between Dire Dawa and Harar has been disrupted .
According to news reports reaching us from there , East Harargee zone looks like a war zone today .
Ever since November 2015 , the people of this area , just like in other Oromiyaaa zones , have been confronting the Wayyaanes bravely .
Although the killings and the threats of intimidation by the enemy have filled the town of Awodaay with grief and wailing , the people have refused to give in . They were not willing to kneel and be ruled by them .
The Weyane killed 5 Oromo children and wounded many in Aweday :
Today 5 Oromo children were killed by the brutal crackdown of the Agazi in Awoday .
Based on the information from Haramaya Hospital , many were also wounded .
Oromo children that were brutally killed by the bullets of the Woyane include : Fendishe Nasir , Seyfedin Abdusabur Hasso , Obsa Yasin , Muna Turki and Firomsa Ahmedsadik .
A 9 years old child was one of those killed .
In addition to those killed , many were also wounded .
Most reported is the killing of Oromo children by Abdi Idris , who is the chairman of Kebele 02 , Aweday , with the gun he was armed by Weyane .
Even though the people burned his house , he is under the shelter of his masters who armed him to gun down Oromos .
The town of Awoday is under gunshot and it is occupied by the Agazi force .
But the people of the town did not surrender .
The people have been demonstrating against Woyane by chanting about the murdered children .
Report say that the people from the nearby including residents of Haremaya town are showing solidarity to the people of Aweday town .
It has been known that the road connecting Dire Dawa and Harar is closed as a result .
Based on the information available to us , East Hararge zone turned into a battle field today .
In this part of the region , people from other Oromia zones have been struggling against the Weyane with patriotism .
Even though the killing and threatening of enemy , especially in Awoday town , was very sad ; the people still never surrendered .
The killing of Oromo people in their own country and their desperate conditions in neighboring countries have made them fodder for ocean fish . We have to work hard to improve the conditions of Oromo refugees in Africa and the way that they receive assistance from UNHCR .
The sinking of a ship carrying several hundred refugees while travelling from Egypt to Italy was the saddening and demoralizing news of the week .
According to various news sources , at least 400 lives have been lost in the disaster .
The fact that half of these were Oromo youths is a matter of grave concern , according to news sources .
We wish every consolation to the relatives of the victims and to all Oromo people .
Oromos are fleeing from the killings , arrests and threats of the Wayyaanees .
Oromo youths are fleeing in their thousands only to save their lives , and not to destroy other lives .
What is saddening is that , far from fleeing and finding jobs , we have now reached a difficult time , but .
At this point in time , Oromo youths are unable to live in their own country .
Besides , they have lost all prospect of living in neighboring countries .
Life for numerous Oromo youths has become bitter in Kenya , Somalia , Sudan and Djibouti .
Our refugees in these countries have been denied justice and their rightful refugee rights , while their demands have received no attention from the UNHCR . They are being made a plaything of the police and security forces of these neighboring countries .
All of this has rendered them hopeless and caused them to flee blindly towards the Sahara lowlands and the ocean .
The problems facing the Oromo refugees in neighboring countries are indeed numerous , immense and worrying .
The problem that prompts Oromos to flee their country is obvious , then and now .
Oromos are being hunted down and killed , and those who survive the attacks are being herded into prisons .
They are tortured in the prisons .
Our women are played with .
Besides this , those that flee to neighboring countries to save their lives and to escape such big problems are denied any response when they request asylum .
They are thrown into refugee camps .
They are ravaged by starvation and diseases .
Their youth is wasted and is overtaken by the weakness of advancing old age .
It is this sense of rejection and isolation that has caused our youths to lose hope and forced them to venture into more difficult situations .
It is difficult to tell Oromo youths , or in fact all youths of other countries , to stay where there is no hope .
Even though they are destroyed by the thousands in the Sahara , the Mediterranean Sea or in the Red Sea , it is difficult to silently endure conditions in the hope that things might improve today or tomorrow .
The lives buried in the graves of Sahara sands and others that were swallowed up by the fish of the oceans could not even at the very least obtain proper burial .
Losing this generation in such conditions is , in fact , worrying to all of humanity .
It is very difficult to bear the grief and destruction caused to the Oromo people as a result of the loss of this generation .
It is saddening to note that the lot of the Oromo people has become one of grief every month of every year .
What is even more worrisome is that the Oromos will be subjected to killings or tossed away as food for the fish until the economic problems of the country have been resolved .
As a result of the absence of any hope in neighboring countries , the youths don't appear to hesitate to venture into a difficult life in the lowlands , or even on the oceans .
Some take hold of their knives .
What could the solution be ?
It is difficult to find a quick and satisfactory solution .
Even though it is difficult to find a suitable solution , something remains to be done .
And that is to work hard to improve the conditions whereby Oromo refugees are received in various African countries and obtain assistance from the UNHCR , especially for Oromo communities in various countries .
It is obvious that the situation of the refugees in neighboring countries is grave ; many of us have experienced such circumstances .
In recent years , the killing of Oromos by the Ethiopian government has worsened , while the factors that force Oromos to flee their homes have multiplied .
In the meantime , the attitude of neighboring countries towards the Oromo people has not changed .
What is saddening is that our people have not yet obtained sufficient attention from the UNHCR and other refugee assistance bodies .
This has got to be improved .
This can only be improved if we Oromos conduct a united struggle at the international level .
Our refugees in neighboring countries need to get the required recognition and assistance , including education , food , accommodation and jobs .
It is impossible to remain a refugee one's whole life ; there needs to be a solution .
Neighboring countries cannot provide a lasting solution for all of the refugees .
However , if neighboring countries join with the Western countries , and the UNHCR and refugee support organizations give sufficient assistance and attention to Oromo affairs , this can somewhat reduce the rate at which Oromos risk their lives by jumping into the ocean .
To realize this , a lot is expected of the Oromo people .
It is the duty of Diaspora Oromos to advocate for the rights of refugees , and to make an effort to see to it that Oromo problems are recognized at the international level .
It is only when you shout that neighbors will reach out to you !
It is wrong to simply sit down and engage in counting our dead from the lowlands and the oceans .
Let us speak out in defense of Oromo rights .
Let us work hard so that Oromo problems get sufficient international attention .
It is the killing and hopelessness in their country that is making the Oromos the victims of sharks ; We have to work hard to improve the condition under which the Oromo refugees are welcomed by different African countries and the protection they are provided by the UNHCR .
The sinking of the boat packed with hundreds of refugees that was traveling from Egypt to Italy is a very sad and touching story of this week .
As different sources indicate , at least 400 people lost their lives in this tragedy .
It is a very sad story to all of us that about half of the victims are Oromo youths .
We extend our condolences to families of victims and to all Oromo people .
Oromo is taking refuge to escape from the killing , imprisonment and threatening of the Weyane .
Thousands of Oromo youth are migrating to save rather than their lives .
What makes the story of the migrants sad is that they are getting it difficult to survive let alone lead a god life , but .
It is in this times that the Oromo youth could not live in their country .
Likewise , they became hopeless about life in a foreign countries .
The life of the Oromo youth living in Kenya , Somalia , Sudan and Djibouti .
They were deprived of justice and truth in the country they took refuge ; their questions lacked response from the UNCHR ( United Nations Higher Commission for Refugees ) and they became victims of maltreatment by the alien police and security forces .
All these made them to lose hope and to dare venturing into the Sahara desert and the shores of the Mediterranean blindly .
The hardship that has been and is being suffered by the Oromo refugees in foreign countries is tough and horrible .
The problem that is deriving the Oromos out of their countries both in the past and present is known .
The Oromos are hunted and killed ; those who fortunately survived the killings will be thrown into jail .
They are tortured in prison .
Our women are abused .
After escaping to save one's own life , they seek asylum in neighboring countries , but get no response .
They are thrown into refugee camps .
They suffer from hunger and thirst .
They are forced to spend their young age in Kakuma and Dadab .
It is negligence and total marginalization that forced our youth to lose hope and engage in a journey of no return .
It is difficult to convince the Oromo or any other youth to stay in a place where there is no hope .
It is difficult to keep silent and patient hoping that it will get better tommorrow , even while witnessing the death of thousands in the Sahara desert , the Mediterranean and the Red sea .
The corpus of those who perish in the Sahara desert and the seas becomes a food for fishes as it cannot even get proper burial .
Not assisting this generation in such tragedies should be the concern of all human beings .
Especially , the grief and sorrow of honest Oromos while losing the next generation is great and difficult .
It is very sad that the life of Oromos is full of grievance every month and the year .
The point of great concern is the continuing trend of dying and ending up as a food for a fish till the political and economic question of the Oromo's is resolved .
Despite the hopelessness and the hardship that is awaiting them in the neigbouring countries , it appears that the youth will not refrain from migrating into the deserts and shores .
One who is in trouble holds knife !
What should the resolution be ?
It is difficult to get easy and satisfying resolution .
Even though it is difficult to avoid this problem from its root , there are still many things to be done .
Working hard on improving the conditions under which Oromo refugees , especially Oromo communities living in different countries , are welcomed and supported by the UNCHR .
It is clearly known that the situations faced by our refugees in neighboring countries is evil ; many of us has already experienced it .
The killing of Oromos by the the Ethiopian government has worsened since recent years and conditions that force the Oromos to flee their country has multiplied .
Regardless of these all , the attitude of neighboring countries towards Oromos remains unchanged .
The sad thing is that our people are not yet given enough attention by the UNCHR and other organizations working for refugees .
This should be improved .
It can be improved by the united struggle we Oromos make at the international stage .
Our refugees in neighboring countries should get all the respect and support that they need ( education , food , accommodation and job ).
They cannot live as refugees for life : they need lasting resolution .
Neighboring countries cannot give lasting resolution to many refugees .
However , if neighboring countries , western countries , UNHCR and organizations working for refugees give enough support and attention to the Oromos , the problem of Oromo refugees may get at least temporary resolution and their loosing of hope may be minimized .
To realize this , many things are expected of us as an Oromo .
Advocating for the right of our refugees , and working to give their problem an international recognition is the obligation of every Oromo living in the world .
Your neighbor comes to rescue you if you cry !
If we keep quite we will only keep counting the death tolls at the desert and the shores .
Lets stand for the right of Oromo refugees .
Let us work hard so that the problem of the Oromo gets an international attention it deserves .
The Woyane should understand that , despite the killings by the Agazi and the dispatch of the tanks against them , the Oromo have carried their struggle thus far . The slogan is to kill HD Oromo .
Killing , manhunting and mobilizing tanks against civilians has been a reality for the last four months .
Oh people , that nothing worse should come !
" መንግስት የህዝቡን ሠላም በሚያደፈርሱና ሃብታና ንብረት ለማውደም በሚንቀሳቀሱ የጥፋት ሃይሎች ላይ የማያዳግም እርምጃ እንደሚወስድ ጠቅላይ ሚንስትር ኃይለማርያም ደሣለኝ ገለጹ ፡፡" Hailemariam Desalegn said this , thinking of the inevitable burning of his palace and the washing away of it by the Oromo flood .
Remember , this guy made the same promise on December 16 .
But the Oromo did not pay attention to him , and the Qeerroo did not care about his threats .
Hailemariam Desalegn talks with a Woyanee mouth , and the Oromo understand that .
This guy has kneeled down , and he wants us to kneel down .
Does he really think the Oromo and the Qeerroo would listen to him ?
When will he understand that the Oromo affair is out of the control of the Woyanee ?
This new statement holds nothing new , other than slaughtering us in daylight .
The truth is that we have been subject to individual killings at home , and to being kidnapped on the streets and put in detention .
The only thing that is new and that we have not heard before is the threatening actions following the statements .
Getting killed is not new to us .
We know all too well that we are fighting to end the killings and arbitrary detentions .
It is difficult to know how long these bugs will keep gorging themselves on the Oromo and Oromia .
It is not about the Oromo protest against them , they have no respect any more .
OPDO is not in place .
It is not likely that we will kneel down like before and carry the Axum statues around .
Hailemariam and his bosses do not know this , or do not want to accept it .
If they have brains , they have to swallow the truth , no matter how bitter it may be .
They chose for now to kill Qerroo , spread a network of threats , and dismiss them with propaganda .
At this moment , when we have almost climbed the hill , will he hold us back by mere threats ?
Does he think we will abandon our question of rights so easily ?
Dictators always roar and believe they will endure forever as they are depleted internally and hit externally by wind and rain , to ultimately meet their deserved downfall .
To know the fate of the Woyanee , one does not need to be a prophet .
Although they know one hundred per cent that the Oromos don't need them , they want to stay .
They are now making a final effort to survive their inevitable death .
Talking a lot , like Abay Tsehay and Getachew Reda , would result in trying to hold back one's own sputum .
The work of the Oromo and Qeerroo should be to pressure the enemy , and stop their breath .
This is the time when the Oromo will show who they are to the others !
The Woyane should know that the struggle of the Oromos reached to the level it has reached now because they were murdered by the Agazi thanks to the Slogan of HD which is killing Oromos ..
The Killing , hunting and deployment of tanks against civilians is what we experienced during the last 4 months .
You heroes;there is nothing that will come after all !
" Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stated that the government will take a fatal measure against those evil forces who are attempting to instill instability and destroy the property of investors ." Hailemariam Desalegn , is one to lose and be engulfed by the ocean of the Oromo .
Remember , this person promised the same thing onDecember 16 .
But , Oromos never heard what he says and the youth never listened to his threat .
Hailemariam Desalegn is the mouth piece of Woyane , and all people know this fact well .
He knelt down for himself and wants us to kneel down like him .
Do you think that the Oromo youth wants to listen to him at this time ?
When will he understand that the fate of the Oromos has slipped out of the Woyane's hand ?
Unless it is intended to openly butcher us , the current proclamation has no thing new in it .
The truth is that we have been killed at home , kidnapped from street and taken to prison .
The new thing that we have been unaware of and never seen before is that no one will go out after the threatening proclamation .
Death is not new to us .
We know that we are struggling to bring an end to the killing and imprisonment .
It is difficult to know for how long they will live as parasites on Oromo and Oromia like tick .
The shame they are facing is not only the protest of the Oromos .
OPDO belongs to no one .
After all it seems that she will not return to embrace the Axum monument .
Hailemariam and his master do not know or are not willing to know .
If they have at least a little understanding , they should have accepted the truth no matter how it is bitter to them .
For now they preferred to kill , threaten and demoralize the youth with their propaganda .
At this time , when we are getting on top , can a threat make us retreat back ?
Can they make us drop the question of justice we embraced ?
The tyrant is stumbling both internally and externally due to lose of strength while disseminating its marred propaganda .
It does not require the skill of forecasting to know the fact about the Weyane .
While witnessing a full hatred by the Oromo , they talk as if they are normal ..
Those who are on the verge of death are at the final stage of their battle . Now they are at the final battle : the struggle made by one at verge of death .
Talking too much like Abay Tsehaye and Getachew Reda leads to eating once own tail .
The action of the Oromo youth is pressing the enemy down and depriving them breath .
It is time to show who the Oromos are for all;this is the time !
A total of 1.4 billion dollars is needed to rescue the starving Ethiopian people from death . As of the month of June , about 15 million people are said to need relief food aid .
The amount obtained up until now is a mere 167 million dollars .
According to a France 24 news report , the Ethiopian government , by focusing on what it calls development works , has so far refused to admit the severity of the drought and famine crisis in the country .
And according to the United Nations , the refusal of the government to give proper attention to this problem has complicated matters amid the prevailing famine conditions .
It is now a long time since the people of various regions , including Oromiyaa , Somalia and Afar , have lost their crops and livestock .
The UN has reported that mothers and children have been exposed to severe living conditions due to the shortage of food .
Currently , the famine occurring in different parts of the country has left millions of citizens on the verge of death and annihilation .
According to the UN , over 15 million people will have nothing to eat until June if emergency food aid is not forthcoming .
The UN has issued repeated bulletins that 1.4 billion dollars is required to save the lives of the people .
Only 167 million dollars has been obtained so far in various forms from the international community .
The UN report warns that millions of people , especially women and children , cannot escape death in the event that this problem remains unresolved .
Oxfam's representative in Ethiopia , Aymen Omer , told the BBC that emergency relief assistance needs to reach Oxfam immediately .
He also warned that the situation may get out of control if this is not achieved .
It is the government which should have given priority to finding a solution for the natural and man-made disasters now plaguing the nation in the first place .
But what is happening in Ethiopia at present is contrary to this reality .
The trend in Ethiopia has always been to neglect looming disasters , and also to hide such disasters or to downplay their magnitude .
This has also been noticed during this year's famine disaster .
It is doubtful if any satisfactory result can be obtained by running here and there at the eleventh hour to collect assistance , after the crops and livestock have all perished and the people have lost their lives for lack of food .
Even if such assistance is obtained , it will come too late , long after many souls have been buried or turned into bones .
It may , of course , not be possible to avert El Nino conditions .
Failure to foresee El Nino and the resulting disaster , as well as failure to make the required preparations , will only expose the people to disaster , and this is a gross mistake .
What is worthy of special note is that El Nino affects not only Ethiopia but also the entire world .
But it is only the Ethiopian people who are now starving and on the verge of death .
And it is precisely because of this that the Ethiopian government is restlessly striving to hide things and avoid taking responsibility .
To rescue the life of starved people in Ethiopia , $1.4 billion is needed . As of June , 15 million people need food aid .
The aid obtained so far is only $167 million .
The report of France 24 says that the Ethiopian government has been blamed for its economic growth propaganda and refusal to confess the magnitude of the drought that the country is facing .
According to the United Nations ' report , the failure of the government to timely deal with the problem has worsened the situation .
The people in different regions ( Oromia , Somali , Afar ) have lost their animals and farms .
DMG reported that children and the elderly are getting exposed to different problems due to lack of food .
Currently , starvation is pushing millions of people in different regions of the country towards the verge of death .
Based on the report of the United Nations , unless urgent aid is provided up to June 15 , millions of people will not have anything to eat .
The report of DMG shows that $1.4 billion is needed to rescue the life of starved people .
But , the aid obtained so far from the international community is only $167 million .
As the report of the United Nations shows , if the situation continues the same way , there will be no chance for millions of people , especially children and the elderly , to escape from death .
The Director of Oxfam in Ethiopia , Mr . Aymen Omer , told BBC that urgent aid must be provided .
He said that otherwise the situation will go beyond control .
The responsibility to forecast and take action to save people from natural and manmade disasters is of government .
In Ethiopia the Ethiopian case is always to the contrary .
Let alone forecasting and prepararing for disaster risk prevention prior to occurrence , the tradition is hiding and lessening its magnitude even after it occurred .
The same thing was observed on the drought of this year .
It is doubtful that the attempt at home and abroad to collect aid will be successful after people lose their crops , animals and lives .
Even if there is aid to come , it will be after people turned into soil .
It may be impossible to prevent the occurrence of EL Nino .
But it is a great shame failing to forecast the impacts of El Nino and exposing people to such greater risk due to absence of the necessary preparedness .
It must be clear that Ethiopia is not exceptional in facing El Nino .
But it is only the Ethiopian people who are now starving and on the verge of death .
And it is precisely because of this that the Ethiopian government is restlessly striving to hide things and avoid taking responsibility .
Oromos have risen in a united struggle even in the midst of repression . The Oromiya Radio and TV organization said that its employees have been abducted and others forced to stop working .
The Oromo people's resistance against the system of slavery does not seem to have cooled down as claimed by the government .
What is seen and heard seems to contradict what is claimed in some quarters .
Having totally removed the sense of fear from their hearts , the Oromo people continue to stage their resistance protests at different places in the country .
Today's demonstrations are exceptionally serious and widespread , stretching from Haramaya to Anfillo in Wallaga , and from Selale to Shashemanne .
Waving aside the threats of intimidation or gunfire from government forces , the people held strong protests in Ammaya , Kiramu , Abootee , Gindo and Goha towns . They took to the streets , telling the enemy that enough is enough .
What happened in Ambo and at the University of Dire Dawa today is appalling , as government forces operated in the shadows .
In Ambo , government forces committed untold killings and suffering on the people who came out into the streets to receive the dead body of Abdata Olana .
The town has not yet recovered from the shock and injuries caused by government forces . The town looks like a ghost town , overwhelmed by grief and sorrow .
Ambo has just entered a new phase of a black scenario .
A similar phenomenon was also observed in Burayu .
Dire Dawa and Haramaya look like war zones . Students at Dire Dawa say they won't stop their protests until they realize their aspirations for freedom and democracy .
Although we cannot give the full extent of the damage , we are told that total darkness seems to prevail at the university , which now looks like a war zone .
It is to be recalled that the various protests staged in various other universities were quelled in a similar manner .
It seems that government forces resorted to night killings , in order to make it impossible for students to record voices and take pictures .
In any case , it is revealed that a number of people were killed or wounded as a result of the brutal actions taken by government forces against the students .
Eyewitnesses said that those who escaped death or arrest are being hunted down and dragged off to the Addelle military camp .
Residents near the Addelle camp are worried about the lives of those taken there for torture .
The Oromo Radio and TV Organization said that its staff members are being abducted or expelled from their jobs . It said that the damage inflicted by the government forces on students and town residents is spilling over to others also .
The bitter actions taken by the government forces against government employees shows the brutality of this despotic regime .
The staff members of the Oromo Radio and TV Organization are among those in the forefront of boldly resisting government policies to humiliate the Oromo people .
The recent arrest of journalist Fiqadu Mirkana is now beginning to knock at the doors of Bilise Qan'aa , another journalist .
Their destruction ?
Being an Oromo is becoming synonymous with standing for truth .
Fighting face to face against those that carry false propaganda in support of oppression has exposed people like Bilise to suffering .
Bilise took advantage of a formal meeting to condemn any move to blackmail and sling mud against the Oromo people through hostile propaganda .
This proud Oromo nationalist asked at the meeting what crime Fiqadu Mirkana has committed to deserve arrest .
Bilisee paid a sacrifice for this .
The role played by Bilise and Fiqadu has contributed to making Oromo concerns and interests known to the public .
In the last few years , the Oromo Radio and TV Organization has fired 18 journalists from their jobs .
The ongoing Oromo resistance movement has continued unabated , with the active involvement of urban and rural dwellers , students and Oromo nationals everywhere , thereby pleasing the hearts of citizens and breaking the backbone of the enemy .
This is welcome .
After all , this is what the Oromo people have been aspiring to and praying for during the past 25 years .
The day has just dawned for the Oromos .
It seems that there is no power that can prevent the united Oromo from struggling for their right : the Oromia television and radio continued repressing and firing its employees .
The antigovernment protest that is underway by the Oromo is not abating or stopping unlike what the government says and wishes to see .
The truth that the eyes see and the ears hear is quite different .
The Oromo already dropped all their fears from their heart and vowed to undo with colonialism and are struggling by taking part in antigovernment protest demonstrations in different places .
Today's movement is extensive as it involved Oromia towns from Haramaya to Anfilo ( Wollega ) and from Selale to Shashamane .
The people of Ameya , Kiremu , Abote , Gindo and Goha towns rushed to streets and said enough without giving any attention to the threat of shooting from government forces .
what happened today in Ambo and Dire Dawa University is quite different .
In Ambo the brutal forces deployed by the government terrorized the people waiting for the body of Abdeta with live ammunitions .
The town that did not learn lesson from the past , claimed no indemnity for the sacrificed , is still filled with grief and terror .
Ambo is again thrown to the depth of darkness .
Burayu is in different colours tonight .
Dire Dawa and Haramaya are turned into a battle ground . The students of Dire Dawa University said they will never give up till they see freedom and democracy .
Even though we do not know the extent of injury they sustained , the action of soldiers deployed against students of the University has turned the University dark . Dire Dawa also chaned into a battle ground .
It is recalled that light uniformly went off during the protests in different Universities this week .
This might be the strategy used by the armed force to kill in darkness so that students can't record video or take photograph of the real situation .
By the brutal action taken by the military against students and residents of Haramaya , many people were injured and there is also death causality .
One witnesses say that those who escaped the killings and intimidation are being hunted and taken to a military camp in Adele .
Residents of the locality express their concern that those who were taken to Adele military camp may suffer torture and inhuman treatment .
Oromia television and radio continued to repress and fire their employees . On the other hand , the Oromo protest is not creating hardship only for students and residents .
Employees of government institutions are also suffering from the brutal treatment of the dictatorial regime .
To halt the protest demonstration underway in all directions Oromia , television and radio is playing key role by blaming Oromos and firing them from jobs .
This institution which sent Fikadu Mirkana to prison few weeks ago again closed its door to Bilise Kenea .
What is wrong with them ?
Being Oromo and standing for truth .
Standing for justice and telling the truth for institutions and officials that are reliant on false propaganda and cannot dare to speak or hear the truth entails problem similar with that of Bilise .
On the meeting convened , even though she was blamed for saying " it is not fair to paint mad on the truth that the Oromos embrace ", she told the truth to those who heard her .
This Oromo patriot also asked why Fikadu Mirkana was imprisoned .
It is this patriotic determination that made Bilise to pay such scarifies .
Many Oromos who openly told the truth faced the inhuman treatment of the dictatorial regime .
It is also recalled that Oromia television and radio agency fired 18 journalists from their job without any ground last year .
The social explosion of the Oromo people this year , which involved both rural and urban people , students and farmers , is pride for the Oromos and it ashamed the enemy .
Good thing .
What is now happening is what the Oromos have been wishing and dreaming 25 years ago .
Now it is dawning for the Oromos .
The number of people in Ethiopia exposed to the drought crisis has reached 7.5 million .
The government has admitted that the number of people in Ethiopia exposed to the drought crisis this year has reached 7.5 million .
According to a government statement , the number of people exposed to starvation and requiring emergency relief food aid has far exceeded the number that was reported last August when it stood at 4.5 million .
The United Nations has warned that unless swift action is taken now , the number of drought-affected people could reach 15 million .
This means that the number of famine-exposed citizens can become far higher than the number of Syrian refugees who have been displaced from their homes because of the war .
The UN has warned that a big disaster is around the corner if swift action is not taken .
Meanwhile , UNHCR has revealed that over 300,000 children in Ethiopia are suffering for lack of food .
The organization called FEWS NET that issues early warnings disclosed that livestock also continue to perish .
The areas worst hit by drought in Ethiopia this year are Afar region , East and Central Oromia , as well as the southern Somali region .
While Ethiopia has secured only 33 million dollars in support of drought-hit people , the UN said an estimated 237 million dollars is needed to rescue the people suffering from starvation .
The country's government claims that the drought crisis has been caused by the lack of rain and El Nino-induced factors .
The number of people who are vulnerable to the drought reached 7.5 million . People in Afar , Oromia and Somali regions are affected by the drought . .
The Ethiopian government confessed that the number of people affected by the drought reached 7.5 million .
In accordance with the statement of the government , the number of people in need of emergency food aid has increased by far than the number reported in August ( 4.5 million ).
The United Nations ( UN ) warned that unless timely measure is taken , the number of people vulnerable to drought will reach 15 million .
This means the number of citizens vulnerable to drought exceeds the number of Syrian people who were exiled due to war and became victims of starvation and other problems .
The UN warned unless immediate action is taken , serious problem will follow .
In connection with this , UNICEF announced that more than 300,000 children are suffering from shortage of food in Ethiopia .
Drought warning organization ( FEWS NET ) said that the death of animals continued in Ethiopia .
East Afar , East and central Oromia and Southern Somali are the places that are suffering from drought this year .
Even though the Ethiopian government obtained $33 million aid for drought affected people , the United Nations says that $237 million is needed to save the life of people starving in Ethiopia .
The government of the country said that the drought of this year worsened due to the absence of rain and El Nino .
Dispute over Oromian land appears to be going in the direction of uprooting EPRDF/OPDO very soon . If any wind of democracy happens to blow in Ethiopia , however light it may seem , it is unlikely that OPDO will gain victory , says Abdii Gammachu from Oromia .
The protest demonstrations being staged in support of the Oromo Federalist Congress ( OFC ) show that , unless votes are stolen as usual , chances for EPRDF/OPDO electoral victory is minimal .
The demonstrations , besides revamping the public image of OFC , appear to indicate that OPDO looks like a house whose roofs are being blown away by the wind .
Residents of Ambo , Shashamane , Nekemte , Dodola , Chiro , Jaldu , and other towns expressed their support and love for OFC while expressing their aversion towards the party in power . This shows the heightened level of consciousness , bravery , and maturity of the people .
The party in power has made and is still making every effort to hinder the people from participating in the OFC-called support demonstrations .
However , these efforts have not succeeded .
The people have cast away all fear of those that frighten them .
Recall that the government has arrested many people over two rounds of elections in the last ten winters .
After more than ten years , this system of oppression now looks completely outdated ..
Observers say the knot they fastened is now being loosened .
But the government does not seem willing to handle this in a positive way .
The fact that the people in the past five rounds stayed in OPDO membership nominally or under compulsion can now be evidenced by their rejection of OPDO calls and their support for OFC calls without any fear of losing their salary , jobs , and even their families .
There can be no better evidence to show that OPDO is now standing alone .
They have to understand that the people , in body and mind , are able to live without others ' paternalism .
Vainglory is tantamount to building a house on a body of water , and the government needs to understand this .
The government has ruled this country , especially the Oromos , in the last 24 years not because of love and popular support it obtained , but by threats of intimidation and kidnapping .
In the last 24 years , there has been nothing that the people have not experienced -- killings , arrests , persecution , and fleeing from their country .
The reality today is that the people have no fear in their hearts at all .
In the words of one man , " We die in our homes ; why fear then ?
Our children have been dying up until now .
It is better for us to die while fighting for our rights and honor ."
His statement seems to provide a fuller picture of the prevailing situation .
The people are not unaware of the consequences of supporting OFC and what awaits them after the election .
Enough is enough !
" Come what may ," say many people .
Really , is any change coming ?
There is hope in the minds of many people , however small it might look .
Responding to OFC calls and standing beside Dr Marara and Obbo Bulcha alone cannot bring about fulfillment of our desire and victory , but ...
In order to obtain success in the current election , at least two requirements have to be fulfilled .
First , on voting day , people have to come out en masse and vote for OFC without any fear .
Second , the voice of the people should not be stolen by any outside force .
And perhaps third , a favorable voting atmosphere and presence of observers have to prevail .
In the absence of one of these requirements , the chances for OFC victory will diminish to zero , every other thing being adverse in the first place .
The fulfillment of these requirements by the government is decisive .
It will be a great thing if OFC wins in the election .
This is important not only for national-level development . Owning the Oromia Council , or obtaining a sufficient number of seats , is of far-reaching importance .
For a person who is familiar with the Ethiopian political scenario , all these seem unattainable .
If OFC cannot succeed , this is not because the people have not voted for it .
Rather , it is because of the stealing of votes as observed in the past round of elections .
Everybody remembers the conditions that prevailed in the 2005 election .
The ruling EPRDF party has given permission for the ongoing peaceful demonstrations in order to give the impression to people at the national and international level that democracy , political pluralism with a number of opposition parties , and free elections are in place .
That is what is happening now .
There is no guarantee that the doors which were opened for the protests might not be closed on voting day .
Allowing peaceful protest does not mean also allowing anybody to vote for someone he chooses .
In general , there is nothing to indicate that the EPRDF government will be willing to transfer power to others even in the event of its defeat .
Experiences have proved to us that all the ongoing , hurried activities do not guarantee fair elections .
According to observers , the EPRDF , far from transferring power , is not even allowing fair elections . It has a plan to stay in power for at least 30 years from now on .
All people including OFC supporters remember what the 2005 elections looked like .
At best , EPRDF may give a few seats to the opposition in the national parliament .
EPRDF might have learnt how shameful it is to give just one seat to the opposition out of the 547 seats in parliament .
It will be a big thing if 15 to 55 seats are allotted to the opposition .
Even this cannot bring about any meaningful impact on the country's politics or national policies .
At least people can find a person in their midst who is committed to their cause , just like they found Obbo Bulcha during the 2005-2010 period .
The reality in Ethiopia at present does not seem to be outside this .
Given the deplorable condition of the Oromo people at present , this by itself is a great thing .
To an observing heart , the high level of awareness , self-initiative , and bravery of the Oromos at home , especially of youngsters , show the existing situation clearly . And this is a great thing .
The resolve shown by the people in the face of threats and harassment by the Ethiopian government has not killed the morale of the people to bring about change .
This trend lays the groundwork for future realization of the policies of the Oromo liberation struggle .
Victory cannot be expected as a government handout but , rather , comes through a relentless and united struggle .
It has long been known that EPRDF cannot relinquish power by peaceful means .
The aim of this round of elections is only to reiterate this fact .
It is not difficult to imagine that the present heightened consciousness and bravery of the people can do miracles if OFC is further consolidated , and if other Oromo organizations are founded on a more solid foundation .
Apart from this , if , as previously planned , people like Lencho Latera of the ODF had participated in this election , the Oromia movement could have demolished EPRDF houses altogether .
It seems the EPRDF closed doors on Lencho and ODF in realization of these developments in the country .
May we be lucky enough to witness what is going to happen on May 24 .
Generally , the heightened awareness and participation shown by the Oromos at home is worthy of admiration .
You make us proud ; long live !
It seems that the earthquake is about to destroy the house of the EPRDF/OPDO ; even if there is a wind of democracy in Ethiopia , there is no any ground for OPDO to win the election in Oromia , says Abdi Gemechu ( from Oromia ).
The demonstration of the Oromo people in support of OFCf ( Oromo Federalist Congress)this week shows that OPDO/EPRDF has a very narrow chance of winning the election in Oromia unless it rigs the election . .
Pro OFC demonstrations made by the people has raised the status of the party leaving OPDO alone in the middle of the hurricane .
The lack of good opportunity in the country propelled the people of Ambo , Shashamene , Nekemte , Dodola , Chiro , Jeldu and other towns as they voiced their support for OFC and their abomination for the ruling party ; a sign of awareness and patriotism .
The ruling party has been using tactics to prevent the people from demonstrating in support of OFC .
But , it is unlikely that it will succeed ..
The people have already stopped fearing .
It is recalled that the government has suppressed the people for more than a decade using the `1-5 model ' strategy .
After a decade , it seems that the strategy of suppressing people through the `1-5 model ' has expired .
Observers note that the `1-5 model ' strategy has already become futile .
But the government appears to this fact .
What leads to the conclusion that people are forced to accept the `1-5 model `of organization and membership of OPDO is the high rate of OPDO members that join OFC despite the prospect of losing their salaries and families .
There is no any better evidence that shows OPDO is standing alone .
They have to be aware that the people are unwilling to accept their leadership both mentally and physically .
At this point in time , the government's reliance on the `1-5 model ' is just like a house next to a river .
For the last 24 years the government has been governing the people of the country , especially the Oromos , without thier their consent and support ; rather , it has been ruling by threatening , terrorizing and suppressing them .
Nothing can be worse for the people who spent the last 24 years being killed , imprisoned and exiled to other countries .
The current situation reveals that the people have already overcome their fear .
Someone I talked to said , `we are dying at home too .'
Our children have also been livingto die .
It is better to be killed while struggling for our rights and voices .
His statements appear to clearly represent the current situation .
It is not likely that the people supporting OFC fail to understand the existing grievance and foresee what will follow the election .
`Enough.
`Let anything happen ,' it is the decision of the majority .
Will some change come truly ?
Despite being few in number , it appears that there are people like Abdi Weyi who are unique than most people .
The hope of victory cannot be realized only answering to the call of OFC and standing by side of Dr . Merara and Mr . Bulcha , but .
To win the upcoming election this year , two important points should be fulfilled regardless of how small they seem .
First , people should cast their ballot for OFC without any fear on the election day .
Second , the vote of people should not be cheated by the ruling party .
The third important point is that there must be convenient condition and the people should have security guarantee on the day of the election .
If one of these important points go wrong , everything will come to an end before it begins ; the chance of winning for the OFC declines to zero .
For the fulfillment of all these points , actions taken by the government are decisive .
Victory of OFC is great .
Total or satisfactory occupancy seats in Oromia National Council will be an indication on the fairness of the election .
But for someone who is aware of Ethiopian politics , it is not likely that these all will come true .
OFC's inability to win is not because it will not get the vote of the people .
The lesson learned from the last four elections is that people's vote is cheated .
All remember well the result of the 2005 election .
The ruling party of EPRDF may allow a little space for opposition political parties to campaign for election in order to pretend to the people at home and abroad that there is democratic space in the country ..
All that happened so far reveals a similar story .
The act of closing the door on election day , the door that started to be opened because of the demonstration , should not be taken for granted .
The permission of demonstration does not represent allowing people to vote for any party of their choice and respecting the vote of the people .
In general there is no ground to say EPRDF is ready to peacefully handover power if it is defeated in the election .
What our experience so far reminds us is that the pretention of today has no connection with the victory of the future .
Many observers claim that , the day EPRDF will allow strong competition , let alone the date it will hand over power peacefully is too far ; may be if things go in accordance with the plan of EPRDF , it is mandatory to wait for 30 years .
Many supporters of OFC who participated on the demonestration are eager to see the result of the 2015 election .
If EPRDF becomes unusually generous , it will allow opposition parties to have few seats in the federal parliament .
The EPRDF officials might have understood in their discussion how it is shameful and senseless it is to give only 1 seat out of 547 seats to opposition parties .
During this election 15 or 55 seats should be given to members of opposition parties .
This will bring no change to the political atmosphere and policy of the country , but .
At least the people may get those who can speak on their behalf like what Mr . Bulcha and others did during the 2005-2010 political term .
The reality of Ethiopian politics does not allow anything more than that .
To understand the losses that the Oromo are bearing very well is even great .
The demonstration of awareness , patriotism and determination of the local Oromo , and the youth in particular , currently reveals something great for those who are willing to see .
This shows how much the threat by the government cannot keep them indoors and kill their desire for change .
This yields also important message about how the future strategies and methodologies of the Oromo liberation struggle should look like .
Victory or liberation is not something obtained as gift from government ; it is rather something that comes if we stand together , organize ourselves and struggle .
It is known from the very beginning that the EPRDF will not handover power peacefully .
The result of this election is also going to reassure the same .
However , had the OFC been strong enough or had it been other strong Oromo party or parties led by strong Oromos , it is not difficult to imagine the revolution that would take place in Oromia .
In connection with the current real situation of the upcoming election , had it been Lencho Leta and ODF who run for the election , the movement in Oromia would bring down the fall of EPRDF .
It might be due to the awareness of the country's prevalent situation that EPRDF closed the dooron Lencho and ODF .
We have seen what happened so far,and we are eager to see what will happen on and after the 24[th ] of May .
In general , the movement underway at home by the Oromos is appreciable .
We are proud of you !

# Oromoprotests They killed my son and forced me to sit on his dead body .
#MOTHER CRIES .
To listen click here
# A human being who has human feelings should normally understand how shocking and perverse it is to kill her son and let the mother cry , killing a son and forbidding the father to bury the body .
Woyane/TPLF and its lackeys in different groups , who are armed with enemy weapons and invade their homesteads , put the Oromo as a people in dire straits and have no humanity at all .
Nobody would think that this kind of inhuman act would be committed by human beings in the 21[st ] century .
Whatever the situation , a human being should not commit this ugly , shocking and abominable act on fellow human beings .
It is not today that we learned that Woyane/TPLF is an archenemy of the Oromo people .
What are outrageous and inexcusable , though , are the acts of those born to the Oromo , who lived with the Oromo and profited from the Oromo and nevertheless attacked the Oromo .
These people follow the Woyane , and have lost all humanity and commit all sorts of sad , shocking and cruel acts .
The Wayane and these guys , especially those who carry the enemy's weapons and commit crimes out of all proportion to the way people act in the 21[st ] century right within the homes of the Oromos , think that they will get away with it but they won't escape the judgement of the people on the inhuman acts they are committing .
A mother from Gimbi town , a mother from Danbi Dollo town , an Oromo father from Awaday , a father of an Oromo hero from Ginccii , all told the tears of Oromo mothers and fathers from the East , West , South and North flow to fill the river and one day , no doubt , will sweep away these people who are the cause of all this sorrow .
Whoever has seen and heard the crying and wailing of an Oromo mother of a hero from Danbi Dollo would burn with rage and would be incited to further protest .
What has been done to this Oromo mother in fact reveals the true nature of the Wayane , its desperate acts of animalistic barbarism exposed to the world .
It is shocking to hear that somebody killed a son and then ordered the mother to sit on the son's dead body and beat her .
It boggles the mind .
Somebody who does this has no humanity , and is no different from a beast .
It will not be long before we see the end of the wailing of Oromo mothers and grieving fathers , and change to happiness and freedom .
It is Oromo's decision to do away with the suffering and realize liberation . It is by making FXG , the Oromo popular revolution , succeed that will lead this movement forward to realization .
So our decision must be a decision to support FXG and wage war against the enemy from all directions , to do away with the system which makes our mothers and fathers cry , takes away our country and our rights , and exploits our resources and dehumanizes us .
# Liberation for all the people !
# Oromoprotests they killed my son and forced me to seat on his dead body ."
#THE MOTHER IS SOBBING .
To follow up click here .
# As a human being , it is possible to understand how difficult and sad it is to prevent an Oromo mother from attending the burial of her son after killing him and making her cry .
The Woyane/TPLF and their mercenaries , who are wandering in Oromo villages to instill unbearable sorrow on to Oromo people , are not human beings but beasts .
It is difficult to imagine that such immoral act can be committed in the 21[st ] century .
It is very sad to see a human being committing such terrifying , and brutal act against his fellow human being .
It is not today that Woyane/TPLF is identified as the enemy of the Oromo people .
The action committed on Oromos by Oromos themselves and by others who are living with them is very sad and it can never be excused .
Through their inhuman act of supporting Woyane , These people are taking very wild and brutal actions against the Oromo people .
The Woyane and those who are irresponsible , especially those who are carrying the enemy’s weapons and taking action , which is difficult to imagine it happens to a person in this century , against Oromo in the Oromo vicinity ; they surely will face judgment of the vast Oromo population for the actions that they are inhumanely taking against the Oromo population .
The flood like tears of the Oromo mothers in Gimbi , Dembi Dolo , and Aweday towns , fathers of patriots in Ginchi town and all fathers and mothers in East , West , North and South Oromo in general will undoubtedly wipe up those who are committing intolerable crimes against humanity and sawing a grievance on the descent of the Oromo people .
For those of you who have seen and heard the cries and tears of a mother in Dembi Dolo this week , it is not difficult to imagine how much their action is very sad and hurt breaking , , and it will lead to a more intensified defiance and protest .
The crime committed against this Oromo mother revealed the true nature of Weyaneespecially considering that it is the final reaction of hopelessness , an action of a beast that cannot be excused .
It is horrifying to see when a mother whose son is killed is forced to seat on the body of her son and beaten .
This is mind blowing .
The enemy who committed this is not different from a beast .
The day when the tears of Oromo mothers and fathers will stop and turn into happiness and liberation is not far .
It is the determination of the Oromo people to end the grievance and tear through self liberation . . The antigovernment protest of the single largest Oromo people , hence , is to embrace this determination and realize it .
Therefore , to bring an end to those who are making our mothers and fathers cry , depriving us of our rights and resources and even our human dignity , we have to continue our struggle by a means of a coordinated and organized multi dimensional antigovernment protest .

The fighting occasioned by the liyyuu police acting like an army of occupation is a war declared by the colonial Wayyanee regime on the Oromo people .
The fighting occasioned by the liyyuu police acting like an army of occupation is a war declared by the colonial Wayyanee regime on the Oromo people .
( By Dr Tsegaye Ararsaa )
The fighting occasioned by the liyyuu police acting like an army of occupation in the East is a war declared by the colonial Wayyanee regime on the Oromo people that looks like the history of the 1977 war .
Our inestimable heroes back then were determined to pay the ultimate sacrifice and engaged in fighting a two-pronged war unleashed on them - the Derg government during the night ( which called this : "... fighting the Somali infiltrators who were organized with the objective of annexing part of the country beyond the Awash river " and fighting the Somali invaders during the day , who said : "... these are armed by the Derg regime and were dispatched to fight us ..." They fought a bitter war for months in that year , registering an impressive victory by bringing Oromos from all walks of life together without any division , and so laid the foundation of Oromo unity .
That year the organization was young and had no foreign assistance , but moved forward independently .
The enemy propaganda targeting the struggle of the Oromoo freedom fighters created misunderstandings and put the organization in a dangerous situation .
The ongoing propaganda created suspicion among comrades who came from different regions of Oromia to join the struggle , and reached the stage of dispersing these children of a single family .
Thus : "... Hararghe is Islam....Oromos of different religions like the Pentecostal Christians have come to spoil the Islamic faith ...."
Some were desperate and returned home , others gave themselves up , and others fled the country while the determined ones stayed to revive the organization , and preserved hope and created a sense of ownership in the people , so that they cared for it and protected it .
The people also took the responsibility entrusted to them in contributing whatever they had without reservation , including sacrificing the lives of their families to quench long years of thirst for freedom , and for a brief time broke out of the enemy camp and joined the organization in Finfinnee , where people from different regions could get to know each other .
We are witnessing today that the people are demonstrating their determination by organizing themselves all over Oromiyaa and keeping their inherited promise .
Making use of all existing opportunities , the people are getting to learn about each other , exchanging opinions and supporting each other , sharing resources and standing together .
The organizations which claim to fight for the Oromo people should unite and join in the uninterrupted struggle being waged in every corner of Oromia .
We strongly call on all Oromo organizations to use this exemplary opportunity that the people have given them , to unite and to gather their resources together and plan to re-energize that powerful force that can include and organize all of the families and individual homesteads with no exceptions .

The invasion of special police force declared by the EPRDF oppressive regime against Oromo people -
The invasion of special police force declared by the EPRDF oppressive regime against Oromo people -
( By Dr . Tsegaye Ararsa )
The invasion of special police declared by the EPRDF oppressive regime against Oromo people in the East is an event similar with that of histories of 1977 .
In that year the patriots , by joining the struggle with great sacrifices available to them and with determination , fighting the two fronts battle opened on them : night against Derg ( given the name "... Somali intruders organized to annex the land beyond Awash "); day with Somali "... these are armed and deployed by the Derg against us ..." was given to Oromo patriots ), and they scored great victories one of which was the coming to unity of Oromos , which laid foundation for unity of Oromo .
In that year it was a young organization taking steps with self reliance without any foreign aid .
The propaganda disseminated by the enemy against the Oromo liberation patriots in guise of religion had put the organization at great risk .
The propaganda disseminated created suspicion between patriots who came from different parts of Oromia to sustain this struggle and other patriots , in connection with religion , which happened to create division between people of the same father .
They said " Hararge is Islam ..., the Oromos who are having different religion ( Protestant , Christian ) joined this struggle with the intention to spoil the Islam religion ."
in that year , regardless of the fact that there were many who lost hope and returned back to home , surrendered to enemy and fled abroad , those patriots those who were having determination labored for survival of the front as reliable organization to lead the Oromo liberation movement for which all Oromos can pay sacrifices with the sense of ownership .
The people too , took that conviction , and by paying all the sacrifices required up to one's own life and the life of one family for the realization of dreams of long year , though for a short period , it created stage for Oromos to get to know each other at Finfine .
again what we are observing now is the bold truth in which all people across Oromia firmly organizing itself , is evidencing the struggle it inherited
It is certain that the people are using each and every opportunity available to it in looking for one another and sharing information , supporting each other and standing united .
It is sending a call without stop for all organizations who considers that they are struggling for Oromo , to come together and act in unity and support this struggle up to paying blood sacrifices .
" Therefore , for all the organizations standing on the same side with Oromo , by taking role model of this population , by making use of this great opportunity given by the people , considering that they need to have an idea focused on one rationale , we strongly request that a great organization need to be formed again in all sections of Oromiya without missing any family and village of Oromo and by embracing them all ." ,

The students of Haramaayaa University have begun demanding respect for their rights .
OMN : As students at the Technology Campus of Haramaayaa University staged protest demonstrations yesterday evening voicing their demands , soldiers of the TPLF government took action on their campus .
Students at the Technology Campus of Haramaayaa University staged their protests yesterday evening , May 12 , 2016 , demanding that violations of human rights committed against the Oromo people must be stopped .
While the students were staging the demonstrations , the regime resorted to deploying its loyalists in an attempt to change the course of the protests .
But the students went ahead with their peaceful protests , while defending themselves against the regime's forces .
The students said that protecting oneself against those that hinder the interests of the Oromo people plays a major role in speeding up the Oromo people's freedom .
According to one university student , the protesters have been distributing various pamphlets on their campus highlighting the suffering of the people , in addition to chanting various slogans .
Elaborating , the student said that , after all , the purpose of education is to fight in the defense of the rights of the people , and not to sell out the cause of the people to others .
He added that the Oromo people have to stand united in the struggle to realize the right of human equality .
In conclusion , the student conveyed a message to all oppressed people of the country , demanding that they should support the Oromo people's resistance movement and thereby shorten the life of the oppressive system of rule .
It is to be rememebered that four students were brutally killed five months ago by government-deployed forces during protests staged at the same Haramaayaa University .

Haremaya University students started asking for their right .
While Haremaya University students of technology faculty were voicing their protest on a demonstration last night , fighters of TPLF government took actions in their campus .
Haremaya University students of Technology Faculty voiced their protests yesterday evening on May 12,2016 , demanding the halt for the violation of human rights that is committed against the Oromo people .
While the students were staging the demonstrations , the regime has resorted to deploying its loyalists in an attempt to change the course of the protests .
The students made peaceful demonstration refusing spies deployed by the government .
It was said that this will play a key role in eliminating enemies of the Oromo people and realizing Oromo libration .
Students of this University said that leaflets focusing on the situation of the Oromo people were distributed in the compound of the University in addition to slogans chanted by students .
The student said that one should learn to struggle for the right of his people , but not to hand his people to enemies .
He also added that the Oromo people should stand together in unity and work for equality among the people .
This student finally called onall the oppressed and suppressed peoples of the country to stand in solidarity with the Oromo people and bring an end to the dictatorial regime .
-- - sb -- -- It is recalled that four students were killed in Haremaya University by the brutal soldiers that were deployed by the government for the protest demonstration staged before five months .
By Iticha Gudeta .
Although subjected to arrests and beatings , the people have reiterated that their protests against the despotic system of rule will go forward , and shall never slacken .
( Voice of Oromo Liberation - August 06 , 2015 ) Oromo nationals in the West Amboo zone have boycotted a Wayyaanee-sponsored meeting called to destroy the Qeerro Movement of the Oromos and their unity .
The Oromos , drawn together from the various districts of the Amboo zone , have boycotted any meeting called by the government of the EPRDF-TPLF and its puppet the OPDO .
The Wayyaanee government has been striving to destroy the Qerroo liberation movement of the Oromos by killing Oromo protesters in urban and rural areas , arresting them and threatening them with financial penalties . They have also been abducting Oromos that oppose their system of rule . Realizing this , our people have scorned the Wayyaanee scheme to impose an oppressive system , saying , " We shall never attend any meeting called by the Wayyaanees , under any pretext whatsoever , with the motive of suppressing Oromo unity ."
The actions to boycott Wayyaanee-called meetings were mainly taken in the districts of Miidaa Qanyii , Geedoo , Iluu Galaan Ijaajii , Tokkee Kuttaayee Gudar , Xiqur Incinnii , Amboo and Amboo town , Dandii , Gincii , Jalduu , Meettaa Roobii , Gindabarati , and Ada'aa Bargaa , and the boycotts have continued even more forcefully .
Among the actions taken by the Wayyaanees to stop peaceful protests by the Oromos are arresting people at district police stations without due process of law , and imposing financial penalties . This trend has now become commonplace .
Besides this , it has been revealed that the enemy has been closely following students who have been accused of being behind the Oromo resistance movement .
Meanwhile , 12 Oromo students from the 9[th ] and 11[th ] grades accused of organizing the Oromo resistance movement against the Wayyaanee repressive government , especially in Miidaa Qanyii , have been picked up and arrested at Miidaa district's police station by the Federal Police .
The arrested students are : 1 . Student Tolasaa Tashoomaa , 2 . Student Badhaasaa Taakkalaa 3 . Student Warquu Taakkalaa 4 . Student gammachuu Xuqur 5 . Student Dinqaa Xuqur 6 . Student Shallamaa Guutamaa 7 . Student Guutamaa Caalumaa 8 . Student Caallasaa Tarfaa 9 . Student Iddaasaa Deesisaa 10 . Student Mul'isaa Farajaa 11 . and Student Geetuu Tame . These have been accused of inciting the Oromo peoples against the government of the Wayyaanees and have been put under arrest without committing any crime . They are now being tortured in prison by the so-called Command Post , which is engaged in disturbing the peace of the people , according to our sources in Baallamii .
But in spite of the beatings and arrests , the people have vowed not to turn back , and never to obey the oppressive system of rule , come what may .
Being aware of the fact that imprisonment and beating can even strengthen a dog , the people are defying the order of the dictatorial regime .
( voice of Oromo Liberation - August 06 , 2015 ) the Oromo people of West Shewa , Ambo boycotted the meeting called by the Woyane that was intended to halt the struggle of the youth and the people in different woredas of the zone .
The people of Ambo zone boycotted participating on any meeting that was called by EPRDF/TPLF regime and the mercenaries of Woyane , the OPDO .
To halt the struggle for the Oromo liberation by the youth and the people , the Woyane regime penalized the people protesting against them with imprisonment and fine in order to reverse the decision of the Oromo liberation youth to boycott any meeting called by Weyane and started to use different propagandas in rural areas and towns ; but the decision of the youth and the defiance by the people ashamed the district and town administrators of the Woyane regime .
Especially this campaign of boycotting meetings called by Weyane continued at considerable strength in districts of Mida Kenim , Gedo , Ilu Gelan Ijaji , Toke Kutaye Guder , Tikur Inchini , Ambo and Ambo city , Dendi , Ginchi , Jeldu , Meta Robi , Gindeberet towns , and Adaʼa Berga .
The Woyane regime's policy of avenging peaceful demonstrators , by engaging on inhuman treatment of the people through torture at district police offices , imprisonment without trial and monetary penalty clearly demonstrated their enmity to the Oromo people .
In addition , considering that the defiance primarily comes from Oromo youth students , they are conducting special follow up on the students .
As the people in Mida Kegni district have defied totally the administration of the Weyane regime , the federal police and riot police detained 12 students from 9[t][h ] and 11[th ] grade at Mida Kegni police office .
The students detained include : 1 . Student Tolesa Teshome 2 . Student Bedhasa Takele 3 . Student Worku Takele 4 . Student Gemechu Tukur 5 . Student Dinka Tukur 6 . Student Sheleme Gutema 7 . Student Gutema Chaluma 8 . Student Chalasa Terefe 9 . Student Idesa Desisa 10 . Student Mulʼisa Fereja 11 . Student Getu Tame . They were jailed without any offence . Allegedly , they were accused of instigating the people against the government , and the people are under brutal treatment of the Weyane officials through their not officially known and organized parastatal named the command post as reported by Balemi .
Being aware of the fact that imprisonment and beating can even strengthen a dog , they are defying the order of the dictatorial regime .
THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT MADE ON J/YAADDEESSAA DINAA REPRESENTS THE FINAL STAGE OF DESPERATION .
The assassination attempt masterminded by Tamaam Baatii , one of those people who don't understand the history of struggle of the Oromo people because of ethnic bias , has been foiled . The attempt was made in South Africa at 4:30pm on October 16 , 2015 , as the would-be victim was going out for morning Salataa prayers .
The desire to kill J/Yaaddeessaa in South Africa and to replace the OPDO by what they now call the KWO has been foiled , and the would-be victim escaped unharmed except for minor injuries .
This originates from the final stage of hopelessness resulting from political bankruptcy .
This desperate faction had been engaged over the last few years in spreading divisive propaganda aimed at undermining Oromo unity , with the ulterior motive of serving the interests of a few individuals . Such attempts have played a big role in preventing our people from confronting the enemy with a sense of unity .
There is sufficient evidence that the policy of this faction is to facilitate conditions for the realization of a scheme to sell out the Oromo people . It is confirmed that this is the policy of Juneyddin Saaddoo . The story of Juneyddiin Saaddoo is too well-known to recount to our people .
Having served the interests of the enemy for his entire life , thereby undermining the Oromo people's interests , this faction has now renamed itself I/Aanaa B/G/Kamaal Galchuu . With this name , it is now posing as a group fighting for the liberation of the Oromo people . There is sufficient evidence that this faction is serving the interests of the enemy , or the Wayyaanees .
We would therefore like to extend to you a call of Oromo love , requesting that all of you work for the further strengthening of the 40-year-old ABO liberation struggle by frustrating the heinous desires of the minions of our enemy , and to speed up Oromo freedom .
In conclusion , we want to extend our congratulations regarding the failure of the assassination attempt on J/Yaddeessaa Diinaa .
We strongly condemn this act of the enemy , that originated from desperation !
The unity of Oromo fighters shall be consolidated !
Committee of ABO Union in South Africa !
October 19 , 2015 1 U of !
THE KILLING/THREATENING COMMITTED BY THE ENEMY IS AN INDICATION OF THEIR LAST STAGE OF HOPELESSNESS !
The assassination attempt staged by the criminals of history , under the leadership of Temam Bati , who organized people belonging to his home village and clan but have no knowledge about the history of Oromo liberation struggle , was foiled on October 16 , 2015 in South Africa while he was going for morning prayer at 4 : 30 pm .
The wish and hope to murder G/Yadesa and force people to accept the agenda of OPDO under the guise of KWO failed except a minor injury he sustained .
This crime of terrorism emanates from the desperation of political loss .
This group did engage for a few years on a propaganda that is intended to dismantle the unity of the Oromo people and benefit only few individuals . This helped them in holding back the unity of the Oromos against their enemy .
There is tangible evidence that there was a move to prepare the Oromo people for another round of colonialism . It has come to light that this group was led by Junedin Sado . It is not important to tell our people who Junedin Sado is .
After serving the enemies all his life and causing great harm to his people , he took the name Irko Seba , became vice chairman to Kemal Gelchu and he was exposed to be the enemy though he says he is struggling to liberate Oromos .
Following the unity shown by the OLF , we Oromo patriots therefore , shall strengthen the base of the unity that was started by four organizations and shall eliminate the wishes and plans of enemy messengers ; hence , we call you in the name of Oromo to rise against our enemies and realize our liberation .
Finally , we say congratulations for the failed murder attempt against G/Yadessa Dina !
We are against enemy acts derived by hopelessness !
Let unity of Oromo patriots be strengthened !
OLF unity committee of South Africa !
October 19/2015 I U Of !
A statement from Fayisaa Lellisaa regarding the press release from H/Mariam Desalegn .
September 22 , 2016 I have seen the statement by Prime Minister H/Mariam regarding my protest in Rio and my trip to America .
I was not surprised .
The reason is that someone who is always instructed to do something by another person thinks that other people are also like himself .
I always act according to my own beliefs .
If anybody wanted to lead me into the dark like they did to him , I wouldn't go .
I mean that I can rely on myself .
He said he sent me to Rio .
He also said that he accompanied the athletes .
I have never entered their palace .
I was never seen off .
I will never dine or drink with someone who killed my relatives .
He can check among the photos of athletes taken on that day for my picture for evidence .
The farewell meeting with the athletes was an invitation from the President and it was never from him .
I do not think he himself took part in the farewell , and not only myself .
According to the culture and norms of Oromoo that I was born in and grew up in , an adult of his age , especially one who has the responsibility of leading a country , does not lie .
It is a shame for me to even say that he lies .
The reason is that I was brought up in and inherited Oromoo cultural values .
Therefore , this thing is not like what H/Maariyaam says .
What he said was an insult .
What always takes precedence over their job is calling people names , and giving someone a name .
He said that Fayyisaa does not have this capability , but that ABO made him show a protest sign .
In the first place , does he know my capabilities ?
How did he measure me ?
The second thing is , that it is not the members of ABO that caused me to state the problems of my people .
It is my identity .
It is the human rights violations in that country .
For example , my friend Kabbadaa Fayyisaa was detained , and within a month he was burned down in detention along with other prisoners .
The rest are suffering the worst torture by the Ethiopian regime .
It is not ABO that took me there and showed me .
I have been watching and hearing the suppression of my people throughout my life .
I have experienced it , too .
I do not support ABO , nor do I hate it .
Because I am not a politician , but an athlete .
I like my people .
I am ready to die for my people at any time .
I frequently went to visit prisoners in Qilinxo and Mahaakalaawwii , and whenever I entered there I registered my name .
Thus you can find my name there .
I know the problems of that country very well .
To speak the truth , it is the Oromo people and friends of the Oromo who brought me to the USA , not ABO .
They have been killing and detaining a lot of people for allegedly supporting ABO .
The killing of Oromo people should stop now .
I am not guided by a remote control like him .
I am an independent person .
I am self-confident .
Bloodshed would not continue if he would try to reveal the truth as much as he tries to cover up the truth .
Therefore , I do not read text provided to me by another person .
I am not a lackey .
I do not run here and there to deliver messages , and will not do so in the future .
Fayisa Lelisa .
the Press release given by athlete Feyisa Lelisa concerning the statements of H/mariam Desalegn
I have seen the statements said by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia , H/Mariam Dessalegn , on September 22 , 2016 regarding my protest at Rio and my coming to the United States of America .
I wasn't much surprised .
This is because someone who is always surpassed by others perceive others as he perceive himself .
I always focus on my own affairs .
I won't follow it if anyone like him leads me into the darkness .
I mean I am self-reliant .
he stated that he sent me to Rio .
He said that he hosted departure party for him together with other athletes too .
I have never entered their government's palace for a party .
I have never had departure party .
I don't drink and/or eat with a person who killed my relatives .
For proof , he can search for my photograph in the photographs that the athletes had that day and verify it .
It was the president of the country who invited and hosted the departure party for the athletes , but not him surely .
let alone the other things , even I don't think that he has taken part on the party .
In accordance with the Oromo culture and ethics in which I was born and brought up , someone who is adult , specially , a one who has a Geda at hand does not lie .
I am even ashamed to say he lied .
That is because I was brought up with Oromo moral principles and values .
Things are not like what H/Mariam said .
What he said is an insult .
Usually what comes first before their work is insulting and defaming a person .
He said that Feyisa has no such ability ; he was made to protest by OLF members .
First of all , does he know my ability ?
In what way he evaluated me ?
It is not the members of OLF who made me make the voice of my population be heard .
It is my identity .
It is the human rights violation which is prevailing in that country .
for example , my colleague Kebede Feyisa was imprisoned , tortured and burned to death with other prisoners , on September 3/2016 , within a month of his imprisonment .
The remaining ones are experiencing harsh treatment of Ethiopian government very well .
It is not OLF who go there and showed me this .
I was brought up seeing and hearing the suppression committed against my people .
I have also faced it .
I do not support or hate OLF .
It is because I am not politician but athlete .
I love my people .
I am ready to die for my people at any time .
I have been repeatedly visiting prisoners . When I enter into prisons of Kilinto and Mahakelawi , my name was registered .
Thus , you can find my name there .
I mean that I know well the problem which is prevalent in that country .
Frankly speaking , I was brought to USA by Oromo community and their affiliates , not by OLF .
They have been imprisoning and killing many people under pretext that they worked in Unison with OLF .
Hereafter , fooling Oromo people has come to an end .
I am not a puppet that operates with remote control like him .
I am self reliant as one person .
I am selfconfident .
If he strives to disclose the truth to the extent that he strives to hide it , the blood of people would have never flown like ocean .
Therefore , I don't act by dictation of others like H/Mariam .
I am not a messenger .
I have never gone here and there to deliver message and I will never do that in the future .
Feyisa Lelisa .
Polio is being eradicated .
Cholera is appearing .
What about malaria ?
#untranslated
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is working to control the spread of cholera before it affects thousands of people in Africa and the Middle East .
It was disclosed last Sunday , October 24 , during World Polio Day , that fewer children in the world are now affected by polio .
On the other hand , the World Health Organization says that it has to be confirmed that the new malaria vaccination undergoing trial is safe for human health .
The majority of the one million people who die from malaria every year are African children .
Polio is being eliminated .
Cholera is reappearing .
What about malaria ?
Washington DC
WHO or the World Health Organization is making an effort to control the spread of cholera before the outbreak that has been seen in Africa and the Middle East causes thousands of people to panic .
Last Saturday October 24 on the celebration of world Polio day , it was stated that children that are few in number are being affected by Polio .
In other news , the World Health Organization stated that the treatment that was found for malaria must be studied to check the effectiveness of the medicine and that it does not harm people's health .
It is known that malaria kills one million people annually and that a great number of them are children of Africa . Since it affects children the most , the discovery of this new treatment is even more of a good news .

While the Oromo in Israel die for independence and Identity , the Oromo who stated that they are Ethiopians submit the goal to the enemy
While Oromo people are dying for their country and identity , diaspora members who claim to be Ethiopian betray the cause
Just like it happened in the 1990s they're going to put Oromoo under foreign control , they want our people to bow and live speaking another language
They do want Oromo people to remain under the colony of others and speak another language like they did in the 1990s .
The Pride youths of Oromo from within and outside be informed and to stand against it consciously
Oromo youth at home and abroad should be aware of this and resist .
Oromos who organized themselves by saying that they are Ethiopians , for their thirst of power are misrepresenting the sacrifices being made in the country .
The people that claim that Oromoos are Ethiopian for the sake of gaining power are discrediting the sacrifices Oromoos in the country are making for equality .
They do not want speak Oromo Language , they involve on the demonstration ceremony of others and carry their Flag , they don't rise the questions of the Oromo
They don't want to speak the Oromo language , they go to the demonstrations of others and carry other flags , they don't raise Oromo questions that are issues back home .
These People cannot free the Oromo people because a man who prefer slavery cannot free others .
These people cannot liberate the Oromo because one who choses slavery for himself cannot liberate others .
Oromia belongs to the Oromos . The Oromo is under movement for freedom and liberty , and is not to be anti to OPDO . #OromoProtests
Oromiyaa belongs to the Oromoo . The Oromoo are fighting for the right to self-govern not to go back and become the OPDO of a foreigner . #OromoProtests
