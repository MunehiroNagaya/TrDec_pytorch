Yesuus ammaas gadi bahee ti, gara qarqara garba bishaanii dhaqe; ummanni hundinuu gara isaa dhufnaan, inni niis isaan barsiise.  ||| He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. 
Ammoo wanni afaan keeysaa baatu, qalbii yaada namaa keeysaa waan dhuftuuf; isii tu nama najisa.  ||| But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. 
As irratti Yesuus, "Wanni isin ilaaltan tun hundinuu, dhagaan tokko illeen wal irratti odoo hin hafin, guyyaan itti diigamu dhufa jira" isaaniin jedhe.  ||| "As for these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."

Guyyaa hedduun booddee, Yihudoonni walitti qabamanii ti isa ajjeesuuf marihatan.  ||| When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him, 
Haa tahu malee, Yihudoota warra Yesuusiin morman waan sodaataniif jecha, isaan keeysaa nam tokko illeen waa'ee isaa zaahiritti hin dubbanne.  ||| Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.

Ani ammoo, "Yaa Gooftaa koo, sumaatu beeka!" jedhee tiin deebiseefi. Hogguus inni, "Isaan kanneen warra rakkina guddaa keeysaa bahanii dhufani; uffata isaanii tiis dhiiga hoolichaa tiin miicanii addeeysanii ti jiru.  ||| I said to him, "Sir, you know."

Hogguu Yihudoonni Yerusaaleem irraa lubootaa fi Leewoota Yohannisitti erganii, "Ati eenyu?" jedhanii isa gaafachiisan, Yohannis,  ||| And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" 
Kiristoos ammoo, waytuma takka bara baraaf aarsaa dilii dhiheeysee ti, gara harka mirga Rabbii tiin taa'e.  ||| But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,

A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter. 
Yesuus eegas booda ummata san biraa deemee ti mana ol seene; hogguus barattoonni isaa itti dhihaatanii, "Fakkeenya girdaad ooyruu keeysaa nuuf hiiki!" jedhaniin.  ||| Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field." 
Sababa kanaaf Rabbi hikmaa isaa tiin akkuma dubbatetti, 'Nabiyyootaa fi ergamoota isaanittiin erga; warra ergaman kana keeysaa hanga tokko ni ajjeesu kaaniis ni arihatu' jedhe.  ||| Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,'

Why do you wrong each other?' 
Hogguu Yesuus roga gaaraa ti irraa gadi bu'e, ummanni hedduun isa duukaa dha bu'an.  ||| When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. 
Rabbi ammoo akkuma fedhetti soomayyoo ni kannaaf; eeynaa shanyii hundumaa tiif adduma addaan soomayyoo addatti kannaafi.  ||| But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.

Namtichi, haaskuma mataa isaa tuu akka itti bulfatu hin beeyne, mee akkamitti waldaya Rabbii tajaajiluu dandaya ree?  ||| for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?

Yesuus hogguus, "Jawaabni kee sirrii dhaa, atiis tanuma godhii, ni jiraatta!" jedheeni.  ||| And he said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live." 
Irrattuu isiniis Gooftaan keeysan yoom akka dhufu guyyaa isaa hin beeytanii, dammaqaa!  ||| Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 
Yesuus magaalaa Yerusaaleemitti dhihaatee hogguu isii arke, ni booyeef.  ||| And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it, 
Akkana waan taheef, qarshii kuma tokkicha san harkaa fuudhaa tii, kan qarshii kuma kudhan qabuuf kannaa!  ||| So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 
Humniti faradoo sanii afaan isaanii keeysaa fi eegee isaanii keeysa jirti; eegeen isaanii bofa mataa qabu fakkaatti, namootaan miidhuuf itti fayyadamu.  ||| For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents with heads, and by means of them they wound. 
Ammaas achi hiiqee ti, kadhatuma duraa san irra deebi'ee ti kadhate.  ||| And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. 
Harki kee kan mirgaa akka dilii hojjattu yoo si godhe, isa if irraa murii tii darbi; guutummaan qaama kee tii jahannamitti galuu mannaa, dhagna qaama kee tii keeysaa tokko dhabuu tu siif irra wayyaa dha" jedhe.  ||| And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. 
Waan niyyataniis godhanii ti, harka Baarnaabaasii fi Saa'oliin gara manguddoota waldayatti ergan.  ||| And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

Wanniniin amma beeku muraasa, akkumaan ani guutumatti beekametti, hogguus aniis guutumatti beekuufiin taa'a.  ||| For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. 
Roga gaara dhihoo san jiru tokko irra, kunoo bobbaan booyyee dheedaa ti turan.  ||| Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,

I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." 
Hojii irratti hin dhibaawinaa! Ruuhaa finiinaa qabaadhaa! Gooftichaafiis if kannaa kaadamaa!  ||| Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. 
Amantoonni Qiisaariyaa tokkoos ammaas nu wajjiin dhufanii ti, mana Minaason nama biyya Qophroos, nama barattoota duraa keeysaa tokko tahe bira akka qubannuuf nu geeysan.  ||| And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge. 
Manguddoota keeysaa inni tokko ammoo, "Hin booyin! Kunoo, leencichi shanyii Yihudaa, hidda Daawwid keeysaa ka'ee moohee ti jira, inni sumuda kanneen torban mummuree kitaabticha banuu ni dandaya" naan jedhe.  ||| And one of the elders said to me, "Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals." 
"Barattoota isaa tu, halkan odoo nuti hirriibatti jirruu dhufanii, reefka isaa hatanii deeman jedhaa tii ummatatti odeeysaa!  ||| and said, "Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' 
Rabbi maleeykoota isaa keeysaa eenyuuni, "Ati Ilma kiyya, ani arraan si dhalche" yookiin eenyuuni, "Ani isaaf Abbaan taha, inni niis Ilma anaaf taha" jedhee beeka?  ||| For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"?Or again, "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son"?

Waa'ee qaceelummaa ilaalchisee, sababaan ani gara Abbaa, bakka isin asii achi itti ana hin agarretti deemuufi.  ||| concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer;

A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. 
Yesuus ammoo deebisee, "Ani dalagaa isin ajaa'ibsisu tokko godhee tiin jira, hundi keeysanuu ni birrattan.  ||| Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel at it.

Angafa lubootaa warri tahan hundinuu, kannaa fi aarsaa dhiheeysuuf, tajaajila irratti ramadamu; kanaafi inni kuniis, waan dhiheeysu qabaachuun isa barbaachisa.  ||| For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. 
Kiristoos du'aa kan hin kaafamin yoo tahe, lallabuun teenyaas faaydaa hin qabu, amantiin teeysaniis gatii hin qabdu.  ||| And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.
